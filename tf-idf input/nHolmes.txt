    72	I.
    73	
    74	To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
    75	him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
    76	and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
    77	any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that
    78	one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but
    79	admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
    80	reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a
    81	lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never
    82	spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They
    83	were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the
    84	veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner
    85	to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
    86	adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
    87	might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a
    88	sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power
    89	lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a
    90	nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and
    91	that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable
    92	memory.
    93	
    94	I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us
    95	away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the
    96	home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
    97	finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to
    98	absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of
    99	society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in
   100	Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from
   101	week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the
   102	drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still,
   103	as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his
   104	immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in
   105	following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which
   106	had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time
   107	to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons
   108	to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up
   109	of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,
   110	and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so
   111	delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.
   112	Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely
   113	shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of
   114	my former friend and companion.
   115	
   116	One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was
   117	returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to
   118	civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I
   119	passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated
   120	in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the
   121	Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes
   122	again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
   123	His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw
   124	his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against
   125	the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
   126	sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
   127	knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their
   128	own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his
   129	drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
   130	problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which
   131	had formerly been in part my own.
   132	
   133	His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I
   134	think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly
   135	eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,
   136	and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he
   137	stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular
   138	introspective fashion.
   139	
   140	"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have
   141	put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."
   142	
   143	"Seven!" I answered.
   144	
   145	"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more,
   146	I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not
   147	tell me that you intended to go into harness."
   148	
   149	"Then, how do you know?"
   150	
   151	"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
   152	yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and
   153	careless servant girl?"
   154	
   155	"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly
   156	have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true
   157	that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful
   158	mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you
   159	deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has
   160	given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it
   161	out."
   162	
   163	He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands
   164	together.
   165	
   166	"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the
   167	inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it,
   168	the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they
   169	have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round
   170	the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
   171	Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile
   172	weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting
   173	specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a
   174	gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black
   175	mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge
   176	on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted
   177	his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce
   178	him to be an active member of the medical profession."
   179	
   180	I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
   181	process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I
   182	remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously
   183	simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each
   184	successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you
   185	explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good
   186	as yours."
   187	
   188	"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing
   189	himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe.
   190	The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen
   191	the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."
   192	
   193	"Frequently."
   194	
   195	"How often?"
   196	
   197	"Well, some hundreds of times."
   198	
   199	"Then how many are there?"
   200	
   201	"How many? I don't know."
   202	
   203	"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is
   204	just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,
   205	because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are
   206	interested in these little problems, and since you are good
   207	enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you
   208	may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick,
   209	pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.
   210	"It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."
   211	
   212	The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
   213	
   214	"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight
   215	o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a
   216	matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of
   217	the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may
   218	safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which
   219	can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all
   220	quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do
   221	not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."
   222	
   223	"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that
   224	it means?"
   225	
   226	"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before
   227	one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit
   228	theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself.
   229	What do you deduce from it?"
   230	
   231	I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
   232	written.
   233	
   234	"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked,
   235	endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper
   236	could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly
   237	strong and stiff."
   238	
   239	"Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an
   240	English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."
   241	
   242	I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a
   243	large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.
   244	
   245	"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.
   246	
   247	"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."
   248	
   249	"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for
   250	'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a
   251	customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for
   252	'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental
   253	Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.
   254	"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking
   255	country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being
   256	the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous
   257	glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you
   258	make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue
   259	triumphant cloud from his cigarette.
   260	
   261	"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.
   262	
   263	"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you
   264	note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of
   265	you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian
   266	could not have written that. It is the German who is so
   267	uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover
   268	what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and
   269	prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if
   270	I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."
   271	
   272	As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and
   273	grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the
   274	bell. Holmes whistled.
   275	
   276	"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing
   277	out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of
   278	beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in
   279	this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."
   280	
   281	"I think that I had better go, Holmes."
   282	
   283	"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my
   284	Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity
   285	to miss it."
   286	
   287	"But your client--"
   288	
   289	"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he
   290	comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best
   291	attention."
   292	
   293	A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and
   294	in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there
   295	was a loud and authoritative tap.
   296	
   297	"Come in!" said Holmes.
   298	
   299	A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six
   300	inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His
   301	dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked
   302	upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed
   303	across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while
   304	the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined
   305	with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch
   306	which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended
   307	halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with
   308	rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence
   309	which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a
   310	broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper
   311	part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black
   312	vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,
   313	for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower
   314	part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,
   315	with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive
   316	of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.
   317	
   318	"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a
   319	strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He
   320	looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to
   321	address.
   322	
   323	"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and
   324	colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me
   325	in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"
   326	
   327	"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.
   328	I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour
   329	and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most
   330	extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate
   331	with you alone."
   332	
   333	I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me
   334	back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say
   335	before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."
   336	
   337	The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said
   338	he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at
   339	the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At
   340	present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it
   341	may have an influence upon European history."
   342	
   343	"I promise," said Holmes.
   344	
   345	"And I."
   346	
   347	"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The
   348	august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to
   349	you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have
   350	just called myself is not exactly my own."
   351	
   352	"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.
   353	
   354	"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution
   355	has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense
   356	scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of
   357	Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House
   358	of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."
   359	
   360	"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself
   361	down in his armchair and closing his eyes.
   362	
   363	Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
   364	lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him
   365	as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.
   366	Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his
   367	gigantic client.
   368	
   369	"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he
   370	remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."
   371	
   372	The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
   373	uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he
   374	tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You
   375	are right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to
   376	conceal it?"
   377	
   378	"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken
   379	before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich
   380	Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and
   381	hereditary King of Bohemia."
   382	
   383	"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down
   384	once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you
   385	can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in
   386	my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not
   387	confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I
   388	have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting
   389	you."
   390	
   391	"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
   392	
   393	"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a
   394	lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known
   395	adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."
   396	
   397	"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without
   398	opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of
   399	docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it
   400	was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not
   401	at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography
   402	sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a
   403	staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea
   404	fishes.
   405	
   406	"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year
   407	1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera
   408	of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in
   409	London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled
   410	with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and
   411	is now desirous of getting those letters back."
   412	
   413	"Precisely so. But how--"
   414	
   415	"Was there a secret marriage?"
   416	
   417	"None."
   418	
   419	"No legal papers or certificates?"
   420	
   421	"None."
   422	
   423	"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should
   424	produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is
   425	she to prove their authenticity?"
   426	
   427	"There is the writing."
   428	
   429	"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."
   430	
   431	"My private note-paper."
   432	
   433	"Stolen."
   434	
   435	"My own seal."
   436	
   437	"Imitated."
   438	
   439	"My photograph."
   440	
   441	"Bought."
   442	
   443	"We were both in the photograph."
   444	
   445	"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an
   446	indiscretion."
   447	
   448	"I was mad--insane."
   449	
   450	"You have compromised yourself seriously."
   451	
   452	"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."
   453	
   454	"It must be recovered."
   455	
   456	"We have tried and failed."
   457	
   458	"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."
   459	
   460	"She will not sell."
   461	
   462	"Stolen, then."
   463	
   464	"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked
   465	her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice
   466	she has been waylaid. There has been no result."
   467	
   468	"No sign of it?"
   469	
   470	"Absolutely none."
   471	
   472	Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.
   473	
   474	"But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.
   475	
   476	"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the
   477	photograph?"
   478	
   479	"To ruin me."
   480	
   481	"But how?"
   482	
   483	"I am about to be married."
   484	
   485	"So I have heard."
   486	
   487	"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the
   488	King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her
   489	family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a
   490	doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."
   491	
   492	"And Irene Adler?"
   493	
   494	"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I
   495	know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul
   496	of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and
   497	the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry
   498	another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not
   499	go--none."
   500	
   501	"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"
   502	
   503	"I am sure."
   504	
   505	"And why?"
   506	
   507	"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
   508	betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."
   509	
   510	"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That
   511	is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to
   512	look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in
   513	London for the present?"
   514	
   515	"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the
   516	Count Von Kramm."
   517	
   518	"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."
   519	
   520	"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."
   521	
   522	"Then, as to money?"
   523	
   524	"You have carte blanche."
   525	
   526	"Absolutely?"
   527	
   528	"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
   529	to have that photograph."
   530	
   531	"And for present expenses?"
   532	
   533	The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
   534	and laid it on the table.
   535	
   536	"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in
   537	notes," he said.
   538	
   539	Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and
   540	handed it to him.
   541	
   542	"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.
   543	
   544	"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."
   545	
   546	Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the
   547	photograph a cabinet?"
   548	
   549	"It was."
   550	
   551	"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon
   552	have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added,
   553	as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If
   554	you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three
   555	o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."
   556	
   557	
   558	II.
   559	
   560	At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had
   561	not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the
   562	house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down
   563	beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,
   564	however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his
   565	inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and
   566	strange features which were associated with the two crimes which
   567	I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the
   568	exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.
   569	Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my
   570	friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of
   571	a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a
   572	pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
   573	quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most
   574	inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable
   575	success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to
   576	enter into my head.
   577	
   578	It was close upon four before the door opened, and a
   579	drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an
   580	inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.
   581	Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of
   582	disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it
   583	was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he
   584	emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.
   585	Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in
   586	front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.
   587	
   588	"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again
   589	until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the
   590	chair.
   591	
   592	"What is it?"
   593	
   594	"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I
   595	employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."
   596	
   597	"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the
   598	habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."
   599	
   600	"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,
   601	however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this
   602	morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a
   603	wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of
   604	them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found
   605	Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but
   606	built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock
   607	to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well
   608	furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those
   609	preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.
   610	Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window
   611	could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round
   612	it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without
   613	noting anything else of interest.
   614	
   615	"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that
   616	there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the
   617	garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses,
   618	and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two
   619	fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire
   620	about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in
   621	the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but
   622	whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."
   623	
   624	"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.
   625	
   626	"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is
   627	the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the
   628	Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,
   629	drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for
   630	dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.
   631	Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,
   632	handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and
   633	often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See
   634	the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him
   635	home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.
   636	When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up
   637	and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan
   638	of campaign.
   639	
   640	"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the
   641	matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the
   642	relation between them, and what the object of his repeated
   643	visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the
   644	former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his
   645	keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this
   646	question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony
   647	Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the
   648	Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my
   649	inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to
   650	let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the
   651	situation."
   652	
   653	"I am following you closely," I answered.
   654	
   655	"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab
   656	drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a
   657	remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--
   658	evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a
   659	great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the
   660	maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly
   661	at home.
   662	
   663	"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch
   664	glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and
   665	down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see
   666	nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than
   667	before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from
   668	his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he
   669	shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to
   670	the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if
   671	you do it in twenty minutes!'
   672	
   673	"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do
   674	well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau,
   675	the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under
   676	his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of
   677	the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall
   678	door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment,
   679	but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.
   680	
   681	"'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a
   682	sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'
   683	
   684	"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing
   685	whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her
   686	landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked
   687	twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could
   688	object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign
   689	if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to
   690	twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
   691	
   692	"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the
   693	others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their
   694	steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid
   695	the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there
   696	save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who
   697	seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three
   698	standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side
   699	aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.
   700	Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to
   701	me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards
   702	me.
   703	
   704	"'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'
   705	
   706	"'What then?' I asked.
   707	
   708	"'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'
   709	
   710	"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was
   711	I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear,
   712	and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally
   713	assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to
   714	Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and
   715	there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady
   716	on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was
   717	the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my
   718	life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just
   719	now. It seems that there had been some informality about their
   720	license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them
   721	without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance
   722	saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in
   723	search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean
   724	to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion."
   725	
   726	"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what
   727	then?"
   728	
   729	"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if
   730	the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate
   731	very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church
   732	door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and
   733	she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as
   734	usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove
   735	away in different directions, and I went off to make my own
   736	arrangements."
   737	
   738	"Which are?"
   739	
   740	"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the
   741	bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to
   742	be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want
   743	your co-operation."
   744	
   745	"I shall be delighted."
   746	
   747	"You don't mind breaking the law?"
   748	
   749	"Not in the least."
   750	
   751	"Nor running a chance of arrest?"
   752	
   753	"Not in a good cause."
   754	
   755	"Oh, the cause is excellent!"
   756	
   757	"Then I am your man."
   758	
   759	"I was sure that I might rely on you."
   760	
   761	"But what is it you wish?"
   762	
   763	"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to
   764	you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that
   765	our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I
   766	have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must
   767	be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns
   768	from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."
   769	
   770	"And what then?"
   771	
   772	"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to
   773	occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must
   774	not interfere, come what may. You understand?"
   775	
   776	"I am to be neutral?"
   777	
   778	"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small
   779	unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being
   780	conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the
   781	sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close
   782	to that open window."
   783	
   784	"Yes."
   785	
   786	"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."
   787	
   788	"Yes."
   789	
   790	"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what
   791	I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of
   792	fire. You quite follow me?"
   793	
   794	"Entirely."
   795	
   796	"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-
   797	shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-
   798	rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.
   799	Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire,
   800	it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then
   801	walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten
   802	minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"
   803	
   804	"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,
   805	and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry
   806	of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."
   807	
   808	"Precisely."
   809	
   810	"Then you may entirely rely on me."
   811	
   812	"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I
   813	prepare for the new role I have to play."
   814	
   815	He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in
   816	the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist
   817	clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white
   818	tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and
   819	benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have
   820	equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His
   821	expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every
   822	fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as
   823	science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in
   824	crime.
   825	
   826	It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still
   827	wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in
   828	Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just
   829	being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge,
   830	waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such
   831	as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description,
   832	but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On
   833	the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was
   834	remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men
   835	smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his
   836	wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and
   837	several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with
   838	cigars in their mouths.
   839	
   840	"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of
   841	the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The
   842	photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are
   843	that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey
   844	Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his
   845	princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the
   846	photograph?"
   847	
   848	"Where, indeed?"
   849	
   850	"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is
   851	cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's
   852	dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid
   853	and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We
   854	may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."
   855	
   856	"Where, then?"
   857	
   858	"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But
   859	I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive,
   860	and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it
   861	over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but
   862	she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be
   863	brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she
   864	had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she
   865	can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."
   866	
   867	"But it has twice been burgled."
   868	
   869	"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."
   870	
   871	"But how will you look?"
   872	
   873	"I will not look."
   874	
   875	"What then?"
   876	
   877	"I will get her to show me."
   878	
   879	"But she will refuse."
   880	
   881	"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is
   882	her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."
   883	
   884	As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round
   885	the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which
   886	rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of
   887	the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in
   888	the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another
   889	loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce
   890	quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who
   891	took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder,
   892	who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and
   893	in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was
   894	the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who
   895	struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes
   896	dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached
   897	her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood
   898	running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to
   899	their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while
   900	a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle
   901	without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to
   902	attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her,
   903	had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her
   904	superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking
   905	back into the street.
   906	
   907	"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.
   908	
   909	"He is dead," cried several voices.
   910	
   911	"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be
   912	gone before you can get him to hospital."
   913	
   914	"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the
   915	lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a
   916	gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."
   917	
   918	"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"
   919	
   920	"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable
   921	sofa. This way, please!"
   922	
   923	Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out
   924	in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings
   925	from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the
   926	blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay
   927	upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with
   928	compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I
   929	know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life
   930	than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was
   931	conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited
   932	upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery
   933	to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted
   934	to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under
   935	my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are
   936	but preventing her from injuring another.
   937	
   938	Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man
   939	who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the
   940	window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the
   941	signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The
   942	word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of
   943	spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and
   944	servant-maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds
   945	of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I
   946	caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice
   947	of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.
   948	Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner
   949	of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my
   950	friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.
   951	He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we
   952	had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the
   953	Edgeware Road.
   954	
   955	"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could
   956	have been better. It is all right."
   957	
   958	"You have the photograph?"
   959	
   960	"I know where it is."
   961	
   962	"And how did you find out?"
   963	
   964	"She showed me, as I told you she would."
   965	
   966	"I am still in the dark."
   967	
   968	"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter
   969	was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the
   970	street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."
   971	
   972	"I guessed as much."
   973	
   974	"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in
   975	the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand
   976	to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."
   977	
   978	"That also I could fathom."
   979	
   980	"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else
   981	could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room
   982	which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was
   983	determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for
   984	air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your
   985	chance."
   986	
   987	"How did that help you?"
   988	
   989	"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on
   990	fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she
   991	values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have
   992	more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the
   993	Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in
   994	the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby;
   995	an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to
   996	me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious
   997	to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it.
   998	The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were
   999	enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The
  1000	photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the
  1001	right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a
  1002	glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it
  1003	was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed
  1004	from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making
  1005	my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to
  1006	attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had
  1007	come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to
  1008	wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."
  1009	
  1010	"And now?" I asked.
  1011	
  1012	"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King
  1013	to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be
  1014	shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is
  1015	probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the
  1016	photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain
  1017	it with his own hands."
  1018	
  1019	"And when will you call?"
  1020	
  1021	"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall
  1022	have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage
  1023	may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to
  1024	the King without delay."
  1025	
  1026	We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was
  1027	searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
  1028	
  1029	"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."
  1030	
  1031	There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the
  1032	greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had
  1033	hurried by.
  1034	
  1035	"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the
  1036	dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have
  1037	been."
  1038	
  1039	
  1040	III.
  1041	
  1042	I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our
  1043	toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed
  1044	into the room.
  1045	
  1046	"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by
  1047	either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
  1048	
  1049	"Not yet."
  1050	
  1051	"But you have hopes?"
  1052	
  1053	"I have hopes."
  1054	
  1055	"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."
  1056	
  1057	"We must have a cab."
  1058	
  1059	"No, my brougham is waiting."
  1060	
  1061	"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off
  1062	once more for Briony Lodge.
  1063	
  1064	"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.
  1065	
  1066	"Married! When?"
  1067	
  1068	"Yesterday."
  1069	
  1070	"But to whom?"
  1071	
  1072	"To an English lawyer named Norton."
  1073	
  1074	"But she could not love him."
  1075	
  1076	"I am in hopes that she does."
  1077	
  1078	"And why in hopes?"
  1079	
  1080	"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future
  1081	annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your
  1082	Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason
  1083	why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."
  1084	
  1085	"It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own
  1086	station! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a
  1087	moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in
  1088	Serpentine Avenue.
  1089	
  1090	The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood
  1091	upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped
  1092	from the brougham.
  1093	
  1094	"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.
  1095	
  1096	"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a
  1097	questioning and rather startled gaze.
  1098	
  1099	"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She
  1100	left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing
  1101	Cross for the Continent."
  1102	
  1103	"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and
  1104	surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"
  1105	
  1106	"Never to return."
  1107	
  1108	"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."
  1109	
  1110	"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the
  1111	drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was
  1112	scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and
  1113	open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before
  1114	her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small
  1115	sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a
  1116	photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler
  1117	herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to
  1118	"Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend
  1119	tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at
  1120	midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
  1121	
  1122	"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You
  1123	took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a
  1124	suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I
  1125	began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had
  1126	been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly
  1127	be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,
  1128	you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became
  1129	suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind
  1130	old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress
  1131	myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage
  1132	of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to
  1133	watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call
  1134	them, and came down just as you departed.
  1135	
  1136	"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was
  1137	really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock
  1138	Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and
  1139	started for the Temple to see my husband.
  1140	
  1141	"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by
  1142	so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when
  1143	you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in
  1144	peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may
  1145	do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
  1146	wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a
  1147	weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
  1148	take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to
  1149	possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
  1150	
  1151	                                      "Very truly yours,
  1152	                                   "IRENE NORTON, n?e ADLER."
  1153	
  1154	"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when
  1155	we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick
  1156	and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?
  1157	Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"
  1158	
  1159	"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a
  1160	very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am
  1161	sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business
  1162	to a more successful conclusion."
  1163	
  1164	"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be
  1165	more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The
  1166	photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."
  1167	
  1168	"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."
  1169	
  1170	"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can
  1171	reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from
  1172	his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
  1173	
  1174	"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more
  1175	highly," said Holmes.
  1176	
  1177	"You have but to name it."
  1178	
  1179	"This photograph!"
  1180	
  1181	The King stared at him in amazement.
  1182	
  1183	"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."
  1184	
  1185	"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the
  1186	matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning." He
  1187	bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the
  1188	King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his
  1189	chambers.
  1190	
  1191	And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom
  1192	of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were
  1193	beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the
  1194	cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And
  1195	when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her
  1196	photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.
  1197	
  1198	
  1199	
  1200	ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
  1201	
  1202	I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the
  1203	autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a
  1204	very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.
  1205	With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when
  1206	Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door
  1207	behind me.
  1208	
  1209	"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear
  1210	Watson," he said cordially.
  1211	
  1212	"I was afraid that you were engaged."
  1213	
  1214	"So I am. Very much so."
  1215	
  1216	"Then I can wait in the next room."
  1217	
  1218	"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and
  1219	helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no
  1220	doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."
  1221	
  1222	The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of
  1223	greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small
  1224	fat-encircled eyes.
  1225	
  1226	"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and
  1227	putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in
  1228	judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love
  1229	of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum
  1230	routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by
  1231	the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you
  1232	will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own
  1233	little adventures."
  1234	
  1235	"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I
  1236	observed.
  1237	
  1238	"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we
  1239	went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary
  1240	Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary
  1241	combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more
  1242	daring than any effort of the imagination."
  1243	
  1244	"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."
  1245	
  1246	"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my
  1247	view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you
  1248	until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to
  1249	be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call
  1250	upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to
  1251	be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some
  1252	time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique
  1253	things are very often connected not with the larger but with the
  1254	smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for
  1255	doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I
  1256	have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present
  1257	case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is
  1258	certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.
  1259	Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to
  1260	recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend
  1261	Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the
  1262	peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every
  1263	possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some
  1264	slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide
  1265	myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my
  1266	memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the
  1267	facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."
  1268	
  1269	The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some
  1270	little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the
  1271	inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the
  1272	advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper
  1273	flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and
  1274	endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the
  1275	indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.
  1276	
  1277	I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor
  1278	bore every mark of being an average commonplace British
  1279	tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey
  1280	shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat,
  1281	unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy
  1282	Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as
  1283	an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a
  1284	wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether,
  1285	look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save
  1286	his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and
  1287	discontent upon his features.
  1288	
  1289	Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook
  1290	his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.
  1291	"Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual
  1292	labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has
  1293	been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of
  1294	writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."
  1295	
  1296	Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger
  1297	upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.
  1298	
  1299	"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.
  1300	Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did
  1301	manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's
  1302	carpenter."
  1303	
  1304	"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger
  1305	than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more
  1306	developed."
  1307	
  1308	"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"
  1309	
  1310	"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,
  1311	especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you
  1312	use an arc-and-compass breastpin."
  1313	
  1314	"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"
  1315	
  1316	"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for
  1317	five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the
  1318	elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"
  1319	
  1320	"Well, but China?"
  1321	
  1322	"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right
  1323	wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small
  1324	study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature
  1325	of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a
  1326	delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I
  1327	see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter
  1328	becomes even more simple."
  1329	
  1330	Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I
  1331	thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see
  1332	that there was nothing in it, after all."
  1333	
  1334	"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake
  1335	in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my
  1336	poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I
  1337	am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"
  1338	
  1339	"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger
  1340	planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began
  1341	it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."
  1342	
  1343	I took the paper from him and read as follows:
  1344	
  1345	"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late
  1346	Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now
  1347	another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a
  1348	salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services. All
  1349	red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age
  1350	of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at
  1351	eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7
  1352	Pope's Court, Fleet Street."
  1353	
  1354	"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice
  1355	read over the extraordinary announcement.
  1356	
  1357	Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when
  1358	in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?"
  1359	said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us
  1360	all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this
  1361	advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note,
  1362	Doctor, of the paper and the date."
  1363	
  1364	"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months
  1365	ago."
  1366	
  1367	"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"
  1368	
  1369	"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock
  1370	Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small
  1371	pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a
  1372	very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than
  1373	just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants,
  1374	but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but
  1375	that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the
  1376	business."
  1377	
  1378	"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.
  1379	
  1380	"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth,
  1381	either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter
  1382	assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better
  1383	himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after
  1384	all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"
  1385	
  1386	"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employ? who
  1387	comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience
  1388	among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is
  1389	not as remarkable as your advertisement."
  1390	
  1391	"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a
  1392	fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought
  1393	to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar
  1394	like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his
  1395	main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice
  1396	in him."
  1397	
  1398	"He is still with you, I presume?"
  1399	
  1400	"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple
  1401	cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the
  1402	house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very
  1403	quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads
  1404	and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.
  1405	
  1406	"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.
  1407	Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight
  1408	weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:
  1409	
  1410	"'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'
  1411	
  1412	"'Why that?' I asks.
  1413	
  1414	"'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the
  1415	Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who
  1416	gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than
  1417	there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what
  1418	to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's
  1419	a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'
  1420	
  1421	"'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a
  1422	very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of
  1423	my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting
  1424	my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what
  1425	was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.
  1426	
  1427	"'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he
  1428	asked with his eyes open.
  1429	
  1430	"'Never.'
  1431	
  1432	"'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one
  1433	of the vacancies.'
  1434	
  1435	"'And what are they worth?' I asked.
  1436	
  1437	"'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight,
  1438	and it need not interfere very much with one's other
  1439	occupations.'
  1440	
  1441	"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears,
  1442	for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an
  1443	extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.
  1444	
  1445	"'Tell me all about it,' said I.
  1446	
  1447	"'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for
  1448	yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address
  1449	where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out,
  1450	the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah
  1451	Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself
  1452	red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men;
  1453	so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous
  1454	fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the
  1455	interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of
  1456	that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to
  1457	do.'
  1458	
  1459	"'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who
  1460	would apply.'
  1461	
  1462	"'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is
  1463	really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had
  1464	started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the
  1465	old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your
  1466	applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but
  1467	real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.
  1468	Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be
  1469	worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a
  1470	few hundred pounds.'
  1471	
  1472	"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,
  1473	that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed
  1474	to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I
  1475	stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent
  1476	Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might
  1477	prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for
  1478	the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to
  1479	have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for
  1480	the address that was given us in the advertisement.
  1481	
  1482	"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From
  1483	north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in
  1484	his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.
  1485	Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court
  1486	looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought
  1487	there were so many in the whole country as were brought together
  1488	by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they
  1489	were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay;
  1490	but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real
  1491	vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I
  1492	would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear
  1493	of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and
  1494	pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up
  1495	to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream
  1496	upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back
  1497	dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found
  1498	ourselves in the office."
  1499	
  1500	"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked
  1501	Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge
  1502	pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."
  1503	
  1504	"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs
  1505	and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that
  1506	was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate
  1507	as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in
  1508	them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem
  1509	to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn
  1510	came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of
  1511	the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he
  1512	might have a private word with us.
  1513	
  1514	"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is
  1515	willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'
  1516	
  1517	"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has
  1518	every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so
  1519	fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and
  1520	gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he
  1521	plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my
  1522	success.
  1523	
  1524	"'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will,
  1525	however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.'
  1526	With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I
  1527	yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as
  1528	he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we
  1529	have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and
  1530	once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which
  1531	would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the
  1532	window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the
  1533	vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,
  1534	and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there
  1535	was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the
  1536	manager.
  1537	
  1538	"'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of
  1539	the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are
  1540	you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'
  1541	
  1542	"I answered that I had not.
  1543	
  1544	"His face fell immediately.
  1545	
  1546	"'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am
  1547	sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the
  1548	propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their
  1549	maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a
  1550	bachelor.'
  1551	
  1552	"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was
  1553	not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for
  1554	a few minutes he said that it would be all right.
  1555	
  1556	"'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be
  1557	fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a
  1558	head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your
  1559	new duties?'
  1560	
  1561	"'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,'
  1562	said I.
  1563	
  1564	"'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding.
  1565	'I should be able to look after that for you.'
  1566	
  1567	"'What would be the hours?' I asked.
  1568	
  1569	"'Ten to two.'
  1570	
  1571	"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.
  1572	Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just
  1573	before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in
  1574	the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man,
  1575	and that he would see to anything that turned up.
  1576	
  1577	"'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'
  1578	
  1579	"'Is 4 pounds a week.'
  1580	
  1581	"'And the work?'
  1582	
  1583	"'Is purely nominal.'
  1584	
  1585	"'What do you call purely nominal?'
  1586	
  1587	"'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the
  1588	building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole
  1589	position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You
  1590	don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office
  1591	during that time.'
  1592	
  1593	"'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,'
  1594	said I.
  1595	
  1596	"'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness
  1597	nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose
  1598	your billet.'
  1599	
  1600	"'And the work?'
  1601	
  1602	"'Is to copy out the "Encyclopaedia Britannica." There is the first
  1603	volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and
  1604	blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be
  1605	ready to-morrow?'
  1606	
  1607	"'Certainly,' I answered.
  1608	
  1609	"'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you
  1610	once more on the important position which you have been fortunate
  1611	enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with
  1612	my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased
  1613	at my own good fortune.
  1614	
  1615	"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in
  1616	low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the
  1617	whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its
  1618	object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past
  1619	belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay
  1620	such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the
  1621	'Encyclopaedia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to
  1622	cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the
  1623	whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look
  1624	at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a
  1625	quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for
  1626	Pope's Court.
  1627	
  1628	"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as
  1629	possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross
  1630	was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off
  1631	upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from
  1632	time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he
  1633	bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had
  1634	written, and locked the door of the office after me.
  1635	
  1636	"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the
  1637	manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my
  1638	week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week
  1639	after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I
  1640	left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only
  1641	once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at
  1642	all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an
  1643	instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet
  1644	was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk
  1645	the loss of it.
  1646	
  1647	"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about
  1648	Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and
  1649	hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very
  1650	long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly
  1651	filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole
  1652	business came to an end."
  1653	
  1654	"To an end?"
  1655	
  1656	"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as
  1657	usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a
  1658	little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the
  1659	panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."
  1660	
  1661	He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet
  1662	of note-paper. It read in this fashion:
  1663	
  1664	                  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
  1665

  1667	
  1668	                        DISSOLVED.
  1669	
  1670	                     October 9, 1890.
  1671	
  1672	Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the
  1673	rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so
  1674	completely overtopped every other consideration that we both
  1675	burst out into a roar of laughter.
  1676	
  1677	"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our
  1678	client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can
  1679	do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."
  1680	
  1681	"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from
  1682	which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for
  1683	the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you
  1684	will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.
  1685	Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the
  1686	door?"
  1687	
  1688	"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called
  1689	at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything
  1690	about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant
  1691	living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me
  1692	what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had
  1693	never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan
  1694	Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.
  1695	
  1696	"'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'
  1697	
  1698	"'What, the red-headed man?'
  1699	
  1700	"'Yes.'
  1701	
  1702	"'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor
  1703	and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new
  1704	premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'
  1705	
  1706	"'Where could I find him?'
  1707	
  1708	"'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17
  1709	King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'
  1710	
  1711	"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was
  1712	a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever
  1713	heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."
  1714	
  1715	"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.
  1716	
  1717	"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
  1718	assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say
  1719	that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite
  1720	good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place
  1721	without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough
  1722	to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right
  1723	away to you."
  1724	
  1725	"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an
  1726	exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.
  1727	From what you have told me I think that it is possible that
  1728	graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."
  1729	
  1730	"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four
  1731	pound a week."
  1732	
  1733	"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do
  1734	not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary
  1735	league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some
  1736	30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have
  1737	gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have
  1738	lost nothing by them."
  1739	
  1740	"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are,
  1741	and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a
  1742	prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it
  1743	cost them two and thirty pounds."
  1744	
  1745	"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first,
  1746	one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who
  1747	first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he
  1748	been with you?"
  1749	
  1750	"About a month then."
  1751	
  1752	"How did he come?"
  1753	
  1754	"In answer to an advertisement."
  1755	
  1756	"Was he the only applicant?"
  1757	
  1758	"No, I had a dozen."
  1759	
  1760	"Why did you pick him?"
  1761	
  1762	"Because he was handy and would come cheap."
  1763	
  1764	"At half-wages, in fact."
  1765	
  1766	"Yes."
  1767	
  1768	"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"
  1769	
  1770	"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
  1771	though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon
  1772	his forehead."
  1773	
  1774	Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought
  1775	as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are
  1776	pierced for earrings?"
  1777	
  1778	"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he
  1779	was a lad."
  1780	
  1781	"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still
  1782	with you?"
  1783	
  1784	"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."
  1785	
  1786	"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"
  1787	
  1788	"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a
  1789	morning."
  1790	
  1791	"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an
  1792	opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is
  1793	Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."
  1794	
  1795	"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what
  1796	do you make of it all?"
  1797	
  1798	"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most
  1799	mysterious business."
  1800	
  1801	"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less
  1802	mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless
  1803	crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is
  1804	the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this
  1805	matter."
  1806	
  1807	"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.
  1808	
  1809	"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I
  1810	beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled
  1811	himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his
  1812	hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his
  1813	black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.
  1814	I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and
  1815	indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his
  1816	chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put
  1817	his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
  1818	
  1819	"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he
  1820	remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare
  1821	you for a few hours?"
  1822	
  1823	"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very
  1824	absorbing."
  1825	
  1826	"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City
  1827	first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that
  1828	there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is
  1829	rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is
  1830	introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"
  1831	
  1832	We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short
  1833	walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular
  1834	story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky,
  1835	little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy
  1836	two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in
  1837	enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded
  1838	laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and
  1839	uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with
  1840	"JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced
  1841	the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.
  1842	Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
  1843	and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between
  1844	puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down
  1845	again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally
  1846	he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously
  1847	upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up
  1848	to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a
  1849	bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step
  1850	in.
  1851	
  1852	"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would
  1853	go from here to the Strand."
  1854	
  1855	"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly,
  1856	closing the door.
  1857	
  1858	"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is,
  1859	in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring
  1860	I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known
  1861	something of him before."
  1862	
  1863	"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good
  1864	deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you
  1865	inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."
  1866	
  1867	"Not him."
  1868	
  1869	"What then?"
  1870	
  1871	"The knees of his trousers."
  1872	
  1873	"And what did you see?"
  1874	
  1875	"What I expected to see."
  1876	
  1877	"Why did you beat the pavement?"
  1878	
  1879	"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We
  1880	are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg
  1881	Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."
  1882	
  1883	The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the
  1884	corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a
  1885	contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was
  1886	one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City
  1887	to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense
  1888	stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward,
  1889	while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of
  1890	pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line
  1891	of fine shops and stately business premises that they really
  1892	abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
  1893	which we had just quitted.
  1894	
  1895	"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing
  1896	along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the
  1897	houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of
  1898	London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little
  1899	newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank,
  1900	the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building
  1901	depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,
  1902	Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A
  1903	sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where
  1904	all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no
  1905	red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."
  1906	
  1907	My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a
  1908	very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All
  1909	the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect
  1910	happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the
  1911	music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes
  1912	were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the
  1913	relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was
  1914	possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature
  1915	alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and
  1916	astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction
  1917	against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally
  1918	predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from
  1919	extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was
  1920	never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been
  1921	lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his
  1922	black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase
  1923	would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning
  1924	power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were
  1925	unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a
  1926	man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him
  1927	that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I
  1928	felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set
  1929	himself to hunt down.
  1930	
  1931	"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we
  1932	emerged.
  1933	
  1934	"Yes, it would be as well."
  1935	
  1936	"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This
  1937	business at Coburg Square is serious."
  1938	
  1939	"Why serious?"
  1940	
  1941	"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to
  1942	believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being
  1943	Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help
  1944	to-night."
  1945	
  1946	"At what time?"
  1947	
  1948	"Ten will be early enough."
  1949	
  1950	"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."
  1951	
  1952	"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger,
  1953	so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his
  1954	hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the
  1955	crowd.
  1956	
  1957	I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was
  1958	always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings
  1959	with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had
  1960	seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that
  1961	he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to
  1962	happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and
  1963	grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought
  1964	over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed
  1965	copier of the "Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg
  1966	Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.
  1967	What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?
  1968	Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from
  1969	Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a
  1970	formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to
  1971	puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside
  1972	until night should bring an explanation.
  1973	
  1974	It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my
  1975	way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker
  1976	Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered
  1977	the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering
  1978	his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men,
  1979	one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police
  1980	agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a
  1981	very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.
  1982	
  1983	"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his
  1984	pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.
  1985	"Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me
  1986	introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in
  1987	to-night's adventure."
  1988	
  1989	"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in
  1990	his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for
  1991	starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do
  1992	the running down."
  1993	
  1994	"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,"
  1995	observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.
  1996	
  1997	"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said
  1998	the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which
  1999	are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical
  2000	and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It
  2001	is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of
  2002	the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly
  2003	correct than the official force."
  2004	
  2005	"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the
  2006	stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.
  2007	It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I
  2008	have not had my rubber."
  2009	
  2010	"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will
  2011	play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and
  2012	that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather,
  2013	the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will
  2014	be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."
  2015	
  2016	"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a
  2017	young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his
  2018	profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on
  2019	any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John
  2020	Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been
  2021	to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and
  2022	though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to
  2023	find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week,
  2024	and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.
  2025	I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him
  2026	yet."
  2027	
  2028	"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.
  2029	I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I
  2030	agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is
  2031	past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two
  2032	will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the
  2033	second."
  2034	
  2035	Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
  2036	and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in
  2037	the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit
  2038	streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.
  2039	
  2040	"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow
  2041	Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the
  2042	matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is
  2043	not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.
  2044	He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as
  2045	tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we
  2046	are, and they are waiting for us."
  2047	
  2048	We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had
  2049	found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and,
  2050	following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a
  2051	narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.
  2052	Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive
  2053	iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding
  2054	stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr.
  2055	Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us
  2056	down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a
  2057	third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all
  2058	round with crates and massive boxes.
  2059	
  2060	"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he
  2061	held up the lantern and gazed about him.
  2062	
  2063	"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon
  2064	the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite
  2065	hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.
  2066	
  2067	"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes
  2068	severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our
  2069	expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit
  2070	down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"
  2071	
  2072	The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a
  2073	very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his
  2074	knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,
  2075	began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few
  2076	seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again
  2077	and put his glass in his pocket.
  2078	
  2079	"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can
  2080	hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.
  2081	Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their
  2082	work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at
  2083	present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of
  2084	the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.
  2085	Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to
  2086	you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of
  2087	London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at
  2088	present."
  2089	
  2090	"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had
  2091	several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."
  2092	
  2093	"Your French gold?"
  2094	
  2095	"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources
  2096	and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of
  2097	France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to
  2098	unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The
  2099	crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between
  2100	layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at
  2101	present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the
  2102	directors have had misgivings upon the subject."
  2103	
  2104	"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is
  2105	time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an
  2106	hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr.
  2107	Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."
  2108	
  2109	"And sit in the dark?"
  2110	
  2111	"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and
  2112	I thought that, as we were a partie carr?e, you might have your
  2113	rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have
  2114	gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And,
  2115	first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men,
  2116	and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us
  2117	some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate,
  2118	and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a
  2119	light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no
  2120	compunction about shooting them down."
  2121	
  2122	I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case
  2123	behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front
  2124	of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute
  2125	darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot
  2126	metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready
  2127	to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked
  2128	up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and
  2129	subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the
  2130	vault.
  2131	
  2132	"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back
  2133	through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have
  2134	done what I asked you, Jones?"
  2135	
  2136	"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."
  2137	
  2138	"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent
  2139	and wait."
  2140	
  2141	What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but
  2142	an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must
  2143	have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs
  2144	were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my
  2145	nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my
  2146	hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle
  2147	breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,
  2148	heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note
  2149	of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case
  2150	in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint
  2151	of a light.
  2152	
  2153	At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then
  2154	it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then,
  2155	without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand
  2156	appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the
  2157	centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the
  2158	hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then
  2159	it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark
  2160	again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between
  2161	the stones.
  2162	
  2163	Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,
  2164	tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon
  2165	its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed
  2166	the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,
  2167	boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand
  2168	on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and
  2169	waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another
  2170	instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after
  2171	him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face
  2172	and a shock of very red hair.
  2173	
  2174	"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the
  2175	bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"
  2176	
  2177	Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the
  2178	collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of
  2179	rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed
  2180	upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came
  2181	down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone
  2182	floor.
  2183	
  2184	"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no
  2185	chance at all."
  2186	
  2187	"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy
  2188	that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his
  2189	coat-tails."
  2190	
  2191	"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.
  2192	
  2193	"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I
  2194	must compliment you."
  2195	
  2196	"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new
  2197	and effective."
  2198	
  2199	"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker
  2200	at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the
  2201	derbies."
  2202	
  2203	"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,"
  2204	remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.
  2205	"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have
  2206	the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and
  2207	'please.'"
  2208	
  2209	"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would
  2210	you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry
  2211	your Highness to the police-station?"
  2212	
  2213	"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow
  2214	to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the
  2215	detective.
  2216	
  2217	"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them
  2218	from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or
  2219	repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated
  2220	in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts
  2221	at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."
  2222	
  2223	"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.
  2224	John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over
  2225	this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond
  2226	that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in
  2227	many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of
  2228	the Red-headed League."
  2229	
  2230	
  2231	"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning
  2232	as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it
  2233	was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible
  2234	object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of
  2235	the League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get
  2236	this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of
  2237	hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,
  2238	really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was
  2239	no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his
  2240	accomplice's hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw
  2241	him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?
  2242	They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary
  2243	office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and
  2244	together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the
  2245	week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for
  2246	half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive
  2247	for securing the situation."
  2248	
  2249	"But how could you guess what the motive was?"
  2250	
  2251	"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a
  2252	mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The
  2253	man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his
  2254	house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and
  2255	such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something
  2256	out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's
  2257	fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the
  2258	cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then
  2259	I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I
  2260	had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in
  2261	London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which
  2262	took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once
  2263	more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel
  2264	to some other building.
  2265	
  2266	"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I
  2267	surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was
  2268	ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.
  2269	It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the
  2270	assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had
  2271	never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his
  2272	face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have
  2273	remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of
  2274	those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they
  2275	were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and
  2276	Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I
  2277	had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I
  2278	called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank
  2279	directors, with the result that you have seen."
  2280	
  2281	"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt
  2282	to-night?" I asked.
  2283	
  2284	"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that
  2285	they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other
  2286	words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential
  2287	that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the
  2288	bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than
  2289	any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.
  2290	For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."
  2291	
  2292	"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned
  2293	admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings
  2294	true."
  2295	
  2296	"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already
  2297	feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort
  2298	to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little
  2299	problems help me to do so."
  2300	
  2301	"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.
  2302	
  2303	He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of
  2304	some little use," he remarked. "'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre
  2305	c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."
  2306	
  2307	
  2308	
  2309	ADVENTURE III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
  2310	
  2311	"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side
  2312	of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely
  2313	stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We
  2314	would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere
  2315	commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window
  2316	hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the
  2317	roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the
  2318	strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the
  2319	wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and
  2320	leading to the most outr? results, it would make all fiction with
  2321	its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and
  2322	unprofitable."
  2323	
  2324	"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which
  2325	come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and
  2326	vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to
  2327	its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,
  2328	neither fascinating nor artistic."
  2329	
  2330	"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a
  2331	realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the
  2332	police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the
  2333	platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an
  2334	observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend
  2335	upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."
  2336	
  2337	I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking
  2338	so." I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser
  2339	and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout
  2340	three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is
  2341	strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper
  2342	from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the
  2343	first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his
  2344	wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without
  2345	reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of
  2346	course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the
  2347	bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of
  2348	writers could invent nothing more crude."
  2349	
  2350	"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,"
  2351	said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This
  2352	is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged
  2353	in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The
  2354	husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the
  2355	conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of
  2356	winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling
  2357	them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely
  2358	to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a
  2359	pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over
  2360	you in your example."
  2361	
  2362	He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in
  2363	the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his
  2364	homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon
  2365	it.
  2366	
  2367	"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.
  2368	It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my
  2369	assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."
  2370	
  2371	"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which
  2372	sparkled upon his finger.
  2373	
  2374	"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in
  2375	which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it
  2376	even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of
  2377	my little problems."
  2378	
  2379	"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.
  2380	
  2381	"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of
  2382	interest. They are important, you understand, without being
  2383	interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in
  2384	unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation,
  2385	and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the
  2386	charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the
  2387	simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is
  2388	the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter
  2389	which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing
  2390	which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however,
  2391	that I may have something better before very many minutes are
  2392	over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."
  2393	
  2394	He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted
  2395	blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.
  2396	Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite
  2397	there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck,
  2398	and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was
  2399	tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her
  2400	ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous,
  2401	hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated
  2402	backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove
  2403	buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves
  2404	the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp
  2405	clang of the bell.
  2406	
  2407	"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his
  2408	cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always
  2409	means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure
  2410	that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet
  2411	even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously
  2412	wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom
  2413	is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love
  2414	matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or
  2415	grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."
  2416	
  2417	As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons
  2418	entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself
  2419	loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed
  2420	merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed
  2421	her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and,
  2422	having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked
  2423	her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was
  2424	peculiar to him.
  2425	
  2426	"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a
  2427	little trying to do so much typewriting?"
  2428	
  2429	"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters
  2430	are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport
  2431	of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear
  2432	and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've
  2433	heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know
  2434	all that?"
  2435	
  2436	"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know
  2437	things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others
  2438	overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"
  2439	
  2440	"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege,
  2441	whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had
  2442	given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as
  2443	much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in
  2444	my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and
  2445	I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  2446	
  2447	"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked
  2448	Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to
  2449	the ceiling.
  2450	
  2451	Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss
  2452	Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said,
  2453	"for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.
  2454	Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to
  2455	the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he
  2456	would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done,
  2457	it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away
  2458	to you."
  2459	
  2460	"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the
  2461	name is different."
  2462	
  2463	"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny,
  2464	too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."
  2465	
  2466	"And your mother is alive?"
  2467	
  2468	"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr.
  2469	Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and
  2470	a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father
  2471	was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy
  2472	business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the
  2473	foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the
  2474	business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.
  2475	They got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't
  2476	near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."
  2477	
  2478	I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this
  2479	rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he
  2480	had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.
  2481	
  2482	"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the
  2483	business?"
  2484	
  2485	"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle
  2486	Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per
  2487	cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can
  2488	only touch the interest."
  2489	
  2490	"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so
  2491	large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the
  2492	bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in
  2493	every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely
  2494	upon an income of about 60 pounds."
  2495	
  2496	"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you
  2497	understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a
  2498	burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while
  2499	I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the
  2500	time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it
  2501	over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I
  2502	earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can
  2503	often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."
  2504	
  2505	"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes.
  2506	"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as
  2507	freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your
  2508	connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  2509	
  2510	A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked
  2511	nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the
  2512	gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets
  2513	when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and
  2514	sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He
  2515	never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I
  2516	wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I
  2517	was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to
  2518	prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all
  2519	father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing
  2520	fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much
  2521	as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do,
  2522	he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,
  2523	mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it
  2524	was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  2525	
  2526	"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from
  2527	France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."
  2528	
  2529	"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and
  2530	shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying
  2531	anything to a woman, for she would have her way."
  2532	
  2533	"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a
  2534	gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  2535	
  2536	"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if
  2537	we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to
  2538	say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father
  2539	came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house
  2540	any more."
  2541	
  2542	"No?"
  2543	
  2544	"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He
  2545	wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to
  2546	say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But
  2547	then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to
  2548	begin with, and I had not got mine yet."
  2549	
  2550	"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see
  2551	you?"
  2552	
  2553	"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer
  2554	wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each
  2555	other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he
  2556	used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so
  2557	there was no need for father to know."
  2558	
  2559	"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"
  2560	
  2561	"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that
  2562	we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in
  2563	Leadenhall Street--and--"
  2564	
  2565	"What office?"
  2566	
  2567	"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."
  2568	
  2569	"Where did he live, then?"
  2570	
  2571	"He slept on the premises."
  2572	
  2573	"And you don't know his address?"
  2574	
  2575	"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."
  2576	
  2577	"Where did you address your letters, then?"
  2578	
  2579	"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called
  2580	for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be
  2581	chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady,
  2582	so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't
  2583	have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come
  2584	from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the
  2585	machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he
  2586	was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think
  2587	of."
  2588	
  2589	"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom
  2590	of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.
  2591	Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
  2592	
  2593	"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me
  2594	in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to
  2595	be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his
  2596	voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he
  2597	was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat,
  2598	and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always
  2599	well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just
  2600	as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."
  2601	
  2602	"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather,
  2603	returned to France?"
  2604	
  2605	"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we
  2606	should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest
  2607	and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever
  2608	happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite
  2609	right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.
  2610	Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder
  2611	of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the
  2612	week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to
  2613	mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother
  2614	said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like
  2615	that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as
  2616	he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do
  2617	anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the
  2618	company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on
  2619	the very morning of the wedding."
  2620	
  2621	"It missed him, then?"
  2622	
  2623	"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."
  2624	
  2625	"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for
  2626	the Friday. Was it to be in church?"
  2627	
  2628	"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near
  2629	King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.
  2630	Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were
  2631	two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a
  2632	four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the
  2633	street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler
  2634	drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and
  2635	when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one
  2636	there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become
  2637	of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was
  2638	last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything
  2639	since then to throw any light upon what became of him."
  2640	
  2641	"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said
  2642	Holmes.
  2643	
  2644	"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all
  2645	the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to
  2646	be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to
  2647	separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him,
  2648	and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed
  2649	strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since
  2650	gives a meaning to it."
  2651	
  2652	"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some
  2653	unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"
  2654	
  2655	"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he
  2656	would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw
  2657	happened."
  2658	
  2659	"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"
  2660	
  2661	"None."
  2662	
  2663	"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"
  2664	
  2665	"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter
  2666	again."
  2667	
  2668	"And your father? Did you tell him?"
  2669	
  2670	"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had
  2671	happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,
  2672	what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of
  2673	the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my
  2674	money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,
  2675	there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about
  2676	money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what
  2677	could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me
  2678	half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She
  2679	pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob
  2680	heavily into it.
  2681	
  2682	"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and
  2683	I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the
  2684	weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind
  2685	dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel
  2686	vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."
  2687	
  2688	"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"
  2689	
  2690	"I fear not."
  2691	
  2692	"Then what has happened to him?"
  2693	
  2694	"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an
  2695	accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can
  2696	spare."
  2697	
  2698	"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she.
  2699	"Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."
  2700	
  2701	"Thank you. And your address?"
  2702	
  2703	"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."
  2704	
  2705	"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your
  2706	father's place of business?"
  2707	
  2708	"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers
  2709	of Fenchurch Street."
  2710	
  2711	"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will
  2712	leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given
  2713	you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it
  2714	to affect your life."
  2715	
  2716	"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be
  2717	true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."
  2718	
  2719	For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was
  2720	something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which
  2721	compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon
  2722	the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever
  2723	she might be summoned.
  2724	
  2725	Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips
  2726	still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him,
  2727	and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down
  2728	from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a
  2729	counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with
  2730	the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of
  2731	infinite languor in his face.
  2732	
  2733	"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found
  2734	her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way,
  2735	is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you
  2736	consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of
  2737	the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however,
  2738	there were one or two details which were new to me. But the
  2739	maiden herself was most instructive."
  2740	
  2741	"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite
  2742	invisible to me," I remarked.
  2743	
  2744	"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to
  2745	look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring
  2746	you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of
  2747	thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.
  2748	Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe
  2749	it."
  2750	
  2751	"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a
  2752	feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads
  2753	sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her
  2754	dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little
  2755	purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and
  2756	were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't
  2757	observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a
  2758	general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable,
  2759	easy-going way."
  2760	
  2761	Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.
  2762	
  2763	"'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have
  2764	really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed
  2765	everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and
  2766	you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general
  2767	impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My
  2768	first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is
  2769	perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you
  2770	observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most
  2771	useful material for showing traces. The double line a little
  2772	above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table,
  2773	was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,
  2774	leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side
  2775	of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the
  2776	broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and,
  2777	observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I
  2778	ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed
  2779	to surprise her."
  2780	
  2781	"It surprised me."
  2782	
  2783	"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and
  2784	interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots
  2785	which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were
  2786	really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and
  2787	the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower
  2788	buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and
  2789	fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly
  2790	dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned,
  2791	it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."
  2792	
  2793	"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by
  2794	my friend's incisive reasoning.
  2795	
  2796	"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving
  2797	home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right
  2798	glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see
  2799	that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had
  2800	written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been
  2801	this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.
  2802	All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back
  2803	to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised
  2804	description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
  2805	
  2806	I held the little printed slip to the light.
  2807	
  2808	"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman
  2809	named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height;
  2810	strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in
  2811	the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted
  2812	glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen,
  2813	in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert
  2814	chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over
  2815	elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in
  2816	Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"
  2817	
  2818	"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued,
  2819	glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no
  2820	clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There
  2821	is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike
  2822	you."
  2823	
  2824	"They are typewritten," I remarked.
  2825	
  2826	"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the
  2827	neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you
  2828	see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is
  2829	rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive
  2830	--in fact, we may call it conclusive."
  2831	
  2832	"Of what?"
  2833	
  2834	"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it
  2835	bears upon the case?"
  2836	
  2837	"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able
  2838	to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were
  2839	instituted."
  2840	
  2841	"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters,
  2842	which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the
  2843	other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking
  2844	him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow
  2845	evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the
  2846	male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the
  2847	answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem
  2848	upon the shelf for the interim."
  2849	
  2850	I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers
  2851	of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that
  2852	he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy
  2853	demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had
  2854	been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in
  2855	the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler
  2856	photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the
  2857	Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with
  2858	the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle
  2859	indeed which he could not unravel.
  2860	
  2861	I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the
  2862	conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would
  2863	find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up
  2864	to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary
  2865	Sutherland.
  2866	
  2867	A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own
  2868	attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at
  2869	the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six
  2870	o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a
  2871	hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too
  2872	late to assist at the d?nouement of the little mystery. I found
  2873	Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin
  2874	form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable
  2875	array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell
  2876	of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the
  2877	chemical work which was so dear to him.
  2878	
  2879	"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.
  2880	
  2881	"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."
  2882	
  2883	"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.
  2884	
  2885	"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.
  2886	There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said
  2887	yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback
  2888	is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."
  2889	
  2890	"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss
  2891	Sutherland?"
  2892	
  2893	The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet
  2894	opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the
  2895	passage and a tap at the door.
  2896	
  2897	"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said
  2898	Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at
  2899	six. Come in!"
  2900	
  2901	The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some
  2902	thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a
  2903	bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and
  2904	penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of
  2905	us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a
  2906	slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.
  2907	
  2908	"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that
  2909	this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an
  2910	appointment with me for six o'clock?"
  2911	
  2912	"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not
  2913	quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland
  2914	has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far
  2915	better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite
  2916	against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable,
  2917	impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily
  2918	controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I
  2919	did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the
  2920	official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family
  2921	misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless
  2922	expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"
  2923	
  2924	"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to
  2925	believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  2926	
  2927	Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am
  2928	delighted to hear it," he said.
  2929	
  2930	"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has
  2931	really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless
  2932	they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some
  2933	letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one
  2934	side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that
  2935	in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and
  2936	a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other
  2937	characteristics, but those are the more obvious."
  2938	
  2939	"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,
  2940	and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing
  2941	keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.
  2942	
  2943	"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,
  2944	Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another
  2945	little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its
  2946	relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some
  2947	little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come
  2948	from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not
  2949	only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will
  2950	observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen
  2951	other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."
  2952	
  2953	Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I
  2954	cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,"
  2955	he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know
  2956	when you have done it."
  2957	
  2958	"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in
  2959	the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"
  2960	
  2961	"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips
  2962	and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.
  2963	
  2964	"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There
  2965	is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too
  2966	transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that
  2967	it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's
  2968	right! Sit down and let us talk it over."
  2969	
  2970	Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a
  2971	glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he
  2972	stammered.
  2973	
  2974	"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,
  2975	Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a
  2976	petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the
  2977	course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."
  2978	
  2979	The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his
  2980	breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up
  2981	on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands
  2982	in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed,
  2983	than to us.
  2984	
  2985	"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her
  2986	money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the
  2987	daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable
  2988	sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have
  2989	made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it.
  2990	The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate
  2991	and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with
  2992	her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would
  2993	not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would
  2994	mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her
  2995	stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of
  2996	keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of
  2997	people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not
  2998	answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and
  2999	finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain
  3000	ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an
  3001	idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the
  3002	connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself,
  3003	covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with
  3004	a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice
  3005	into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the
  3006	girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off
  3007	other lovers by making love himself."
  3008	
  3009	"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never
  3010	thought that she would have been so carried away."
  3011	
  3012	"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very
  3013	decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that
  3014	her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never
  3015	for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the
  3016	gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the
  3017	loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began
  3018	to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as
  3019	far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There
  3020	were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the
  3021	girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the
  3022	deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys
  3023	to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to
  3024	bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it
  3025	would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and
  3026	prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to
  3027	come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and
  3028	hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening
  3029	on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss
  3030	Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to
  3031	his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not
  3032	listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her,
  3033	and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished
  3034	away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a
  3035	four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of
  3036	events, Mr. Windibank!"
  3037	
  3038	Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes
  3039	had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold
  3040	sneer upon his pale face.
  3041	
  3042	"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you
  3043	are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is
  3044	you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing
  3045	actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door
  3046	locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal
  3047	constraint."
  3048	
  3049	"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking
  3050	and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who
  3051	deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a
  3052	friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!"
  3053	he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon
  3054	the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but
  3055	here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat
  3056	myself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he
  3057	could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,
  3058	the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr.
  3059	James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.
  3060	
  3061	"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he
  3062	threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will
  3063	rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and
  3064	ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not
  3065	entirely devoid of interest."
  3066	
  3067	"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I
  3068	remarked.
  3069	
  3070	"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.
  3071	Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious
  3072	conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really
  3073	profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the
  3074	stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together,
  3075	but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was
  3076	suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice,
  3077	which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My
  3078	suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in
  3079	typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his
  3080	handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even
  3081	the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,
  3082	together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same
  3083	direction."
  3084	
  3085	"And how did you verify them?"
  3086	
  3087	"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I
  3088	knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed
  3089	description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the
  3090	result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I
  3091	sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me
  3092	whether it answered to the description of any of their
  3093	travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the
  3094	typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business
  3095	address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his
  3096	reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but
  3097	characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from
  3098	Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the
  3099	description tallied in every respect with that of their employ?,
  3100	James Windibank. Voil? tout!"
  3101	
  3102	"And Miss Sutherland?"
  3103	
  3104	"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old
  3105	Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger
  3106	cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.'
  3107	There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much
  3108	knowledge of the world."
  3109	
  3110	
  3111	
  3112	ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
  3113	
  3114	We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the
  3115	maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran
  3116	in this way:
  3117	
  3118	"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from
  3119	the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy.
  3120	Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect.
  3121	Leave Paddington by the 11:15."
  3122	
  3123	"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me.
  3124	"Will you go?"
  3125	
  3126	"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at
  3127	present."
  3128	
  3129	"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking
  3130	a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good,
  3131	and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."
  3132	
  3133	"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained
  3134	through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack
  3135	at once, for I have only half an hour."
  3136	
  3137	My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the
  3138	effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were
  3139	few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a
  3140	cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock
  3141	Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt
  3142	figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey
  3143	travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.
  3144	
  3145	"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It
  3146	makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on
  3147	whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless
  3148	or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall
  3149	get the tickets."
  3150	
  3151	We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of
  3152	papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged
  3153	and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until
  3154	we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a
  3155	gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.
  3156	
  3157	"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.
  3158	
  3159	"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."
  3160	
  3161	"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just
  3162	been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the
  3163	particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those
  3164	simple cases which are so extremely difficult."
  3165	
  3166	"That sounds a little paradoxical."
  3167	
  3168	"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a
  3169	clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more
  3170	difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they
  3171	have established a very serious case against the son of the
  3172	murdered man."
  3173	
  3174	"It is a murder, then?"
  3175	
  3176	"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for
  3177	granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into
  3178	it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have
  3179	been able to understand it, in a very few words.
  3180	
  3181	"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in
  3182	Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a
  3183	Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned
  3184	some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he
  3185	held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was
  3186	also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the
  3187	colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to
  3188	settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.
  3189	Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his
  3190	tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect
  3191	equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son,
  3192	a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same
  3193	age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have
  3194	avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to
  3195	have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of
  3196	sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the
  3197	neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl.
  3198	Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the
  3199	least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the
  3200	families. Now for the facts.
  3201	
  3202	"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at
  3203	Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the
  3204	Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out
  3205	of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been
  3206	out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told
  3207	the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of
  3208	importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came
  3209	back alive.
  3210	
  3211	"From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a
  3212	mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One
  3213	was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was
  3214	William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both
  3215	these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The
  3216	game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.
  3217	McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the
  3218	same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the
  3219	father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was
  3220	following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in
  3221	the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
  3222	
  3223	"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder,
  3224	the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly
  3225	wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the
  3226	edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of
  3227	the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the
  3228	woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she
  3229	saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.
  3230	McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a
  3231	violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very
  3232	strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his
  3233	hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their
  3234	violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached
  3235	home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near
  3236	Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to
  3237	fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came
  3238	running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead
  3239	in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was
  3240	much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right
  3241	hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On
  3242	following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the
  3243	grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated
  3244	blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as
  3245	might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's
  3246	gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the
  3247	body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly
  3248	arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned
  3249	at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the
  3250	magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next
  3251	Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out
  3252	before the coroner and the police-court."
  3253	
  3254	"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If
  3255	ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so
  3256	here."
  3257	
  3258	"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes
  3259	thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing,
  3260	but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it
  3261	pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something
  3262	entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case
  3263	looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very
  3264	possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people
  3265	in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the
  3266	daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his
  3267	innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect
  3268	in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in
  3269	his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the
  3270	case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are
  3271	flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly
  3272	digesting their breakfasts at home."
  3273	
  3274	"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you
  3275	will find little credit to be gained out of this case."
  3276	
  3277	"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he
  3278	answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some
  3279	other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to
  3280	Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting
  3281	when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by
  3282	means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of
  3283	understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly
  3284	perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand
  3285	side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted
  3286	even so self-evident a thing as that."
  3287	
  3288	"How on earth--"
  3289	
  3290	"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness
  3291	which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this
  3292	season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less
  3293	and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until
  3294	it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the
  3295	jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated
  3296	than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking
  3297	at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a
  3298	result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and
  3299	inference. Therein lies my m?tier, and it is just possible that
  3300	it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before
  3301	us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in
  3302	the inquest, and which are worth considering."
  3303	
  3304	"What are they?"
  3305	
  3306	"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after
  3307	the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary
  3308	informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not
  3309	surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.
  3310	This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any
  3311	traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the
  3312	coroner's jury."
  3313	
  3314	"It was a confession," I ejaculated.
  3315	
  3316	"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."
  3317	
  3318	"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at
  3319	least a most suspicious remark."
  3320	
  3321	"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I
  3322	can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be,
  3323	he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the
  3324	circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared
  3325	surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I
  3326	should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such
  3327	surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,
  3328	and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His
  3329	frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent
  3330	man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and
  3331	firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not
  3332	unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of
  3333	his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day
  3334	so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and
  3335	even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so
  3336	important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The
  3337	self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark
  3338	appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a
  3339	guilty one."
  3340	
  3341	I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter
  3342	evidence," I remarked.
  3343	
  3344	"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."
  3345	
  3346	"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"
  3347	
  3348	"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters,
  3349	though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.
  3350	You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."
  3351	
  3352	He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire
  3353	paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the
  3354	paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own
  3355	statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the
  3356	corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this
  3357	way:
  3358	
  3359	"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called
  3360	and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for
  3361	three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the
  3362	morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at
  3363	the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he
  3364	had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after
  3365	my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and,
  3366	looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out
  3367	of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was
  3368	going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of
  3369	the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit
  3370	warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William
  3371	Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but
  3372	he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had
  3373	no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards
  3374	from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal
  3375	between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found
  3376	him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at
  3377	seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A
  3378	conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows,
  3379	for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his
  3380	passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned
  3381	towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,
  3382	however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me
  3383	to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground,
  3384	with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in
  3385	my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for
  3386	some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper,
  3387	his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one
  3388	near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by
  3389	his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and
  3390	forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no
  3391	active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'
  3392	
  3393	"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before
  3394	he died?
  3395	
  3396	"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some
  3397	allusion to a rat.
  3398	
  3399	"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?
  3400	
  3401	"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was
  3402	delirious.
  3403	
  3404	"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father
  3405	had this final quarrel?
  3406	
  3407	"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.
  3408	
  3409	"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.
  3410	
  3411	"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can
  3412	assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which
  3413	followed.
  3414	
  3415	"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point
  3416	out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case
  3417	considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.
  3418	
  3419	"Witness: I must still refuse.
  3420	
  3421	"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common
  3422	signal between you and your father?
  3423	
  3424	"Witness: It was.
  3425	
  3426	"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw
  3427	you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?
  3428	
  3429	"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.
  3430	
  3431	"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions
  3432	when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father
  3433	fatally injured?
  3434	
  3435	"Witness: Nothing definite.
  3436	
  3437	"The Coroner: What do you mean?
  3438	
  3439	"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into
  3440	the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet
  3441	I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay
  3442	upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be
  3443	something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps.
  3444	When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was
  3445	gone.
  3446	
  3447	"'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'
  3448	
  3449	"'Yes, it was gone.'
  3450	
  3451	"'You cannot say what it was?'
  3452	
  3453	"'No, I had a feeling something was there.'
  3454	
  3455	"'How far from the body?'
  3456	
  3457	"'A dozen yards or so.'
  3458	
  3459	"'And how far from the edge of the wood?'
  3460	
  3461	"'About the same.'
  3462	
  3463	"'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen
  3464	yards of it?'
  3465	
  3466	"'Yes, but with my back towards it.'
  3467	
  3468	"This concluded the examination of the witness."
  3469	
  3470	"I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner
  3471	in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.
  3472	He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his
  3473	father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his
  3474	refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and
  3475	his singular account of his father's dying words. They are all,
  3476	as he remarks, very much against the son."
  3477	
  3478	Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon
  3479	the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some
  3480	pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the
  3481	young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him
  3482	credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too
  3483	little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would
  3484	give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from
  3485	his own inner consciousness anything so outr? as a dying
  3486	reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No,
  3487	sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what
  3488	this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that
  3489	hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and
  3490	not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the
  3491	scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be
  3492	there in twenty minutes."
  3493	
  3494	It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through
  3495	the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,
  3496	found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A
  3497	lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for
  3498	us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and
  3499	leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic
  3500	surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of
  3501	Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a
  3502	room had already been engaged for us.
  3503	
  3504	"I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup
  3505	of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be
  3506	happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."
  3507	
  3508	"It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It
  3509	is entirely a question of barometric pressure."
  3510	
  3511	Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.
  3512	
  3513	"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud
  3514	in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need
  3515	smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country
  3516	hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I
  3517	shall use the carriage to-night."
  3518	
  3519	Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed
  3520	your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as
  3521	plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer
  3522	it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a
  3523	very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your
  3524	opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing
  3525	which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my
  3526	soul! here is her carriage at the door."
  3527	
  3528	He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the
  3529	most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her
  3530	violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her
  3531	cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her
  3532	overpowering excitement and concern.
  3533	
  3534	"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the
  3535	other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition,
  3536	fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I
  3537	have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it.
  3538	I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it,
  3539	too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each
  3540	other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no
  3541	one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a
  3542	charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."
  3543	
  3544	"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes.
  3545	"You may rely upon my doing all that I can."
  3546	
  3547	"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion?
  3548	Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself
  3549	think that he is innocent?"
  3550	
  3551	"I think that it is very probable."
  3552	
  3553	"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking
  3554	defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."
  3555	
  3556	Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague
  3557	has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.
  3558	
  3559	"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did
  3560	it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the
  3561	reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because
  3562	I was concerned in it."
  3563	
  3564	"In what way?" asked Holmes.
  3565	
  3566	"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had
  3567	many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that
  3568	there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always
  3569	loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young
  3570	and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he
  3571	naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there
  3572	were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."
  3573	
  3574	"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a
  3575	union?"
  3576	
  3577	"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in
  3578	favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as
  3579	Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.
  3580	
  3581	"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father
  3582	if I call to-morrow?"
  3583	
  3584	"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."
  3585	
  3586	"The doctor?"
  3587	
  3588	"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for
  3589	years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken
  3590	to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his
  3591	nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive
  3592	who had known dad in the old days in Victoria."
  3593	
  3594	"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."
  3595	
  3596	"Yes, at the mines."
  3597	
  3598	"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner
  3599	made his money."
  3600	
  3601	"Yes, certainly."
  3602	
  3603	"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to
  3604	me."
  3605	
  3606	"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you
  3607	will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do
  3608	tell him that I know him to be innocent."
  3609	
  3610	"I will, Miss Turner."
  3611	
  3612	"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if
  3613	I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She
  3614	hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we
  3615	heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.
  3616	
  3617	"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a
  3618	few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you
  3619	are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I
  3620	call it cruel."
  3621	
  3622	"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said
  3623	Holmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"
  3624	
  3625	"Yes, but only for you and me."
  3626	
  3627	"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have
  3628	still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"
  3629	
  3630	"Ample."
  3631	
  3632	"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very
  3633	slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."
  3634	
  3635	I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through
  3636	the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel,
  3637	where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a
  3638	yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin,
  3639	however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were
  3640	groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the
  3641	action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and
  3642	gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the
  3643	day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were
  3644	absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely
  3645	unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between
  3646	the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,
  3647	drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was
  3648	something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the
  3649	nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?
  3650	I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which
  3651	contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's
  3652	deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left
  3653	parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
  3654	shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot
  3655	upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from
  3656	behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when
  3657	seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it
  3658	did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his
  3659	back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call
  3660	Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying
  3661	reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be
  3662	delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become
  3663	delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how
  3664	he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my
  3665	brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident
  3666	of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the
  3667	murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his
  3668	overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to
  3669	return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was
  3670	kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a
  3671	tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I
  3672	did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith
  3673	in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long
  3674	as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young
  3675	McCarthy's innocence.
  3676	
  3677	It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,
  3678	for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.
  3679	
  3680	"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down.
  3681	"It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able
  3682	to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his
  3683	very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not
  3684	wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young
  3685	McCarthy."
  3686	
  3687	"And what did you learn from him?"
  3688	
  3689	"Nothing."
  3690	
  3691	"Could he throw no light?"
  3692	
  3693	"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew
  3694	who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced
  3695	now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very
  3696	quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think,
  3697	sound at heart."
  3698	
  3699	"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact
  3700	that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as
  3701	this Miss Turner."
  3702	
  3703	"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,
  3704	insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was
  3705	only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away
  3706	five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get
  3707	into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a
  3708	registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can
  3709	imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not
  3710	doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows
  3711	to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort
  3712	which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father,
  3713	at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss
  3714	Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself,
  3715	and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would
  3716	have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with
  3717	his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in
  3718	Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that
  3719	point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however,
  3720	for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious
  3721	trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and
  3722	has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the
  3723	Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I
  3724	think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all
  3725	that he has suffered."
  3726	
  3727	"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"
  3728	
  3729	"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two
  3730	points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with
  3731	someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his
  3732	son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would
  3733	return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry
  3734	'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the
  3735	crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk
  3736	about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all
  3737	minor matters until to-morrow."
  3738	
  3739	There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke
  3740	bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with
  3741	the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe
  3742	Pool.
  3743	
  3744	"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is
  3745	said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is
  3746	despaired of."
  3747	
  3748	"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.
  3749	
  3750	"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life
  3751	abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This
  3752	business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend
  3753	of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I
  3754	have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."
  3755	
  3756	"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.
  3757	
  3758	"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody
  3759	about here speaks of his kindness to him."
  3760	
  3761	"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this
  3762	McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have
  3763	been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of
  3764	marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably,
  3765	heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner,
  3766	as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would
  3767	follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself
  3768	was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not
  3769	deduce something from that?"
  3770	
  3771	"We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said
  3772	Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle facts,
  3773	Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."
  3774	
  3775	"You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard
  3776	to tackle the facts."
  3777	
  3778	"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it
  3779	difficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.
  3780	
  3781	"And that is--"
  3782	
  3783	"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that
  3784	all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."
  3785	
  3786	"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes,
  3787	laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley
  3788	Farm upon the left."
  3789	
  3790	"Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking
  3791	building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches
  3792	of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless
  3793	chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight
  3794	of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door,
  3795	when the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her
  3796	master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the
  3797	son's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured
  3798	these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes
  3799	desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed
  3800	the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.
  3801	
  3802	Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent
  3803	as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of
  3804	Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed
  3805	and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines,
  3806	while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.
  3807	His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips
  3808	compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,
  3809	sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal
  3810	lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated
  3811	upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell
  3812	unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,
  3813	impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way
  3814	along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of
  3815	the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is
  3816	all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon
  3817	the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either
  3818	side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and
  3819	once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and
  3820	I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous,
  3821	while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the
  3822	conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a
  3823	definite end.
  3824	
  3825	The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water
  3826	some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the
  3827	Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.
  3828	Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see
  3829	the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich
  3830	landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods
  3831	grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass
  3832	twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds
  3833	which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which
  3834	the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,
  3835	that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the
  3836	fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager
  3837	face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read
  3838	upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking
  3839	up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.
  3840	
  3841	"What did you go into the pool for?" he asked.
  3842	
  3843	"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon
  3844	or other trace. But how on earth--"
  3845	
  3846	"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its
  3847	inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and
  3848	there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all
  3849	have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo
  3850	and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the
  3851	lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or
  3852	eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of
  3853	the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his
  3854	waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to
  3855	himself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he
  3856	was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are
  3857	deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his
  3858	story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are
  3859	the father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It
  3860	is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this?
  3861	Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite
  3862	unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course
  3863	that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up
  3864	and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we
  3865	were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a
  3866	great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced
  3867	his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
  3868	his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he
  3869	remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,
  3870	gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and
  3871	examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of
  3872	the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among
  3873	the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then
  3874	he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the
  3875	highroad, where all traces were lost.
  3876	
  3877	"It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked,
  3878	returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on
  3879	the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a
  3880	word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done
  3881	that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,
  3882	and I shall be with you presently."
  3883	
  3884	It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove
  3885	back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he
  3886	had picked up in the wood.
  3887	
  3888	"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out.
  3889	"The murder was done with it."
  3890	
  3891	"I see no marks."
  3892	
  3893	"There are none."
  3894	
  3895	"How do you know, then?"
  3896	
  3897	"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few
  3898	days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It
  3899	corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other
  3900	weapon."
  3901	
  3902	"And the murderer?"
  3903	
  3904	"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears
  3905	thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian
  3906	cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his
  3907	pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be
  3908	enough to aid us in our search."
  3909	
  3910	Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he
  3911	said. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a
  3912	hard-headed British jury."
  3913	
  3914	"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own
  3915	method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon,
  3916	and shall probably return to London by the evening train."
  3917	
  3918	"And leave your case unfinished?"
  3919	
  3920	"No, finished."
  3921	
  3922	"But the mystery?"
  3923	
  3924	"It is solved."
  3925	
  3926	"Who was the criminal, then?"
  3927	
  3928	"The gentleman I describe."
  3929	
  3930	"But who is he?"
  3931	
  3932	"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a
  3933	populous neighbourhood."
  3934	
  3935	Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said,
  3936	"and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking
  3937	for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the
  3938	laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."
  3939	
  3940	"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance.
  3941	Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before
  3942	I leave."
  3943	
  3944	Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where
  3945	we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in
  3946	thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds
  3947	himself in a perplexing position.
  3948	
  3949	"Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit
  3950	down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't
  3951	know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a
  3952	cigar and let me expound."
  3953	
  3954	 "Pray do so."
  3955	
  3956	"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about
  3957	young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly,
  3958	although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One
  3959	was the fact that his father should, according to his account,
  3960	cry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying
  3961	reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but
  3962	that was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double
  3963	point our research must commence, and we will begin it by
  3964	presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."
  3965	
  3966	"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"
  3967	
  3968	"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The
  3969	son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that
  3970	he was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the
  3971	attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But
  3972	'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used
  3973	between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the
  3974	person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was
  3975	someone who had been in Australia."
  3976	
  3977	"What of the rat, then?"
  3978	
  3979	Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened
  3980	it out on the table. "This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,"
  3981	he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand
  3982	over part of the map. "What do you read?"
  3983	
  3984	"ARAT," I read.
  3985	
  3986	"And now?" He raised his hand.
  3987	
  3988	"BALLARAT."
  3989	
  3990	"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his
  3991	son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter
  3992	the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat."
  3993	
  3994	"It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.
  3995	
  3996	"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down
  3997	considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point
  3998	which, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a
  3999	certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite
  4000	conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak."
  4001	
  4002	"Certainly."
  4003	
  4004	"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only
  4005	be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could
  4006	hardly wander."
  4007	
  4008	"Quite so."
  4009	
  4010	"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the
  4011	ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that
  4012	imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal."
  4013	
  4014	"But how did you gain them?"
  4015	
  4016	"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of
  4017	trifles."
  4018	
  4019	"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length
  4020	of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces."
  4021	
  4022	"Yes, they were peculiar boots."
  4023	
  4024	"But his lameness?"
  4025	
  4026	"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than
  4027	his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he
  4028	was lame."
  4029	
  4030	"But his left-handedness."
  4031	
  4032	"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded
  4033	by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from
  4034	immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can
  4035	that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind
  4036	that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had
  4037	even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special
  4038	knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian
  4039	cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and
  4040	written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different
  4041	varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the
  4042	ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
  4043	where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety
  4044	which are rolled in Rotterdam."
  4045	
  4046	"And the cigar-holder?"
  4047	
  4048	"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he
  4049	used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the
  4050	cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife."
  4051	
  4052	"Holmes," I said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which
  4053	he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as
  4054	truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the
  4055	direction in which all this points. The culprit is--"
  4056	
  4057	"Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of
  4058	our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.
  4059	
  4060	The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His
  4061	slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of
  4062	decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and
  4063	his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual
  4064	strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled
  4065	hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air
  4066	of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an
  4067	ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were
  4068	tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that
  4069	he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.
  4070	
  4071	"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my
  4072	note?"
  4073	
  4074	"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to
  4075	see me here to avoid scandal."
  4076	
  4077	"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall."
  4078	
  4079	"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my
  4080	companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question
  4081	was already answered.
  4082	
  4083	"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It
  4084	is so. I know all about McCarthy."
  4085	
  4086	The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried.
  4087	"But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you
  4088	my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at
  4089	the Assizes."
  4090	
  4091	"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.
  4092	
  4093	"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It
  4094	would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears
  4095	that I am arrested."
  4096	
  4097	"It may not come to that," said Holmes.
  4098	
  4099	"What?"
  4100	
  4101	"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter
  4102	who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.
  4103	Young McCarthy must be got off, however."
  4104	
  4105	"I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for
  4106	years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a
  4107	month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."
  4108	
  4109	Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand
  4110	and a bundle of paper before him. "Just tell us the truth," he
  4111	said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson
  4112	here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the
  4113	last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall
  4114	not use it unless it is absolutely needed."
  4115	
  4116	"It's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether I
  4117	shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I
  4118	should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the
  4119	thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but
  4120	will not take me long to tell.
  4121	
  4122	"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil
  4123	incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of
  4124	such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years,
  4125	and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be
  4126	in his power.
  4127	
  4128	"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap
  4129	then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at
  4130	anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck
  4131	with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you
  4132	would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and
  4133	we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time
  4134	to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.
  4135	Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party
  4136	is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.
  4137	
  4138	"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and
  4139	we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers
  4140	and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of
  4141	their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,
  4142	however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of
  4143	the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the
  4144	Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his
  4145	wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every
  4146	feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made
  4147	our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted
  4148	from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and
  4149	respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in
  4150	the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,
  4151	to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too,
  4152	and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.
  4153	Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down
  4154	the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned
  4155	over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was
  4156	going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.
  4157	
  4158	"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in
  4159	Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his
  4160	foot.
  4161	
  4162	"'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be
  4163	as good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and
  4164	you can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine,
  4165	law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman
  4166	within hail.'
  4167	
  4168	"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking
  4169	them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land
  4170	ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness;
  4171	turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my
  4172	elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more
  4173	afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he
  4174	wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without
  4175	question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing
  4176	which I could not give. He asked for Alice.
  4177	
  4178	"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was
  4179	known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that
  4180	his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was
  4181	firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that
  4182	I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that
  4183	was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do
  4184	his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses
  4185	to talk it over.
  4186	
  4187	"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I
  4188	smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.
  4189	But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in
  4190	me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my
  4191	daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she
  4192	were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I
  4193	and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a
  4194	man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and
  4195	a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb,
  4196	I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl!
  4197	Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I
  4198	did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,
  4199	I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl
  4200	should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
  4201	than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction
  4202	than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought
  4203	back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I
  4204	was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in
  4205	my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that
  4206	occurred."
  4207	
  4208	"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man
  4209	signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we
  4210	may never be exposed to such a temptation."
  4211	
  4212	"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"
  4213	
  4214	"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you
  4215	will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the
  4216	Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is
  4217	condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be
  4218	seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or
  4219	dead, shall be safe with us."
  4220	
  4221	"Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds,
  4222	when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace
  4223	which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his
  4224	giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.
  4225	
  4226	"God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate
  4227	play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such
  4228	a case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say,
  4229	'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.'"
  4230	
  4231	James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a
  4232	number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and
  4233	submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven
  4234	months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is
  4235	every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily
  4236	together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their
  4237	past.
  4238	
  4239	
  4240	
  4241	ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
  4242	
  4243	When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes
  4244	cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which
  4245	present strange and interesting features that it is no easy
  4246	matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however,
  4247	have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have
  4248	not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend
  4249	possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of
  4250	these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his
  4251	analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without
  4252	an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and
  4253	have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and
  4254	surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
  4255	him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable
  4256	in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted
  4257	to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are
  4258	points in connection with it which never have been, and probably
  4259	never will be, entirely cleared up.
  4260	
  4261	The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater
  4262	or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my
  4263	headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the
  4264	adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant
  4265	Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a
  4266	furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the
  4267	British barque "Sophy Anderson", of the singular adventures of the
  4268	Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the
  4269	Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered,
  4270	Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to
  4271	prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that
  4272	therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a
  4273	deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the
  4274	case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of
  4275	them present such singular features as the strange train of
  4276	circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.
  4277	
  4278	It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales
  4279	had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had
  4280	screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that
  4281	even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced
  4282	to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and
  4283	to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which
  4284	shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like
  4285	untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew
  4286	higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in
  4287	the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the
  4288	fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the
  4289	other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until
  4290	the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text,
  4291	and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of
  4292	the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a
  4293	few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker
  4294	Street.
  4295	
  4296	"Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the
  4297	bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"
  4298	
  4299	"Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not encourage
  4300	visitors."
  4301	
  4302	"A client, then?"
  4303	
  4304	"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out
  4305	on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more
  4306	likely to be some crony of the landlady's."
  4307	
  4308	Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there
  4309	came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He
  4310	stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and
  4311	towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
  4312	
  4313	"Come in!" said he.
  4314	
  4315	The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the
  4316	outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of
  4317	refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella
  4318	which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told
  4319	of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about
  4320	him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his
  4321	face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is
  4322	weighed down with some great anxiety.
  4323	
  4324	"I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to
  4325	his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have
  4326	brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug
  4327	chamber."
  4328	
  4329	"Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest
  4330	here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from
  4331	the south-west, I see."
  4332	
  4333	"Yes, from Horsham."
  4334	
  4335	"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is
  4336	quite distinctive."
  4337	
  4338	"I have come for advice."
  4339	
  4340	"That is easily got."
  4341	
  4342	"And help."
  4343	
  4344	"That is not always so easy."
  4345	
  4346	"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast
  4347	how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal."
  4348	
  4349	"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."
  4350	
  4351	"He said that you could solve anything."
  4352	
  4353	"He said too much."
  4354	
  4355	"That you are never beaten."
  4356	
  4357	"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a
  4358	woman."
  4359	
  4360	"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?"
  4361	
  4362	"It is true that I have been generally successful."
  4363	
  4364	"Then you may be so with me."
  4365	
  4366	"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me
  4367	with some details as to your case."
  4368	
  4369	"It is no ordinary one."
  4370	
  4371	"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of
  4372	appeal."
  4373	
  4374	"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you
  4375	have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of
  4376	events than those which have happened in my own family."
  4377	
  4378	"You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the
  4379	essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards
  4380	question you as to those details which seem to me to be most
  4381	important."
  4382	
  4383	The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out
  4384	towards the blaze.
  4385	
  4386	"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have,
  4387	as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful
  4388	business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an
  4389	idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the
  4390	affair.
  4391	
  4392	"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias
  4393	and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry,
  4394	which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He
  4395	was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business
  4396	met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire
  4397	upon a handsome competence.
  4398	
  4399	"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and
  4400	became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done
  4401	very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army,
  4402	and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When
  4403	Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where
  4404	he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came
  4405	back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham.
  4406	He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his
  4407	reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his
  4408	dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to
  4409	them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very
  4410	foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring
  4411	disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I
  4412	doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or
  4413	three fields round his house, and there he would take his
  4414	exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave
  4415	his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very
  4416	heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any
  4417	friends, not even his own brother.
  4418	
  4419	"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the
  4420	time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This
  4421	would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years
  4422	in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he
  4423	was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be
  4424	fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would
  4425	make me his representative both with the servants and with the
  4426	tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite
  4427	master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I
  4428	liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in
  4429	his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he
  4430	had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was
  4431	invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or
  4432	anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped
  4433	through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a
  4434	collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such
  4435	a room.
  4436	
  4437	"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp
  4438	lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a
  4439	common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all
  4440	paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From
  4441	India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can
  4442	this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little
  4443	dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to
  4444	laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight
  4445	of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his
  4446	skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he
  4447	still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and
  4448	then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'
  4449	
  4450	"'What is it, uncle?' I cried.
  4451	
  4452	"'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his
  4453	room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope
  4454	and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the
  4455	gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else
  4456	save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his
  4457	overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I
  4458	ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key,
  4459	which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small
  4460	brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.
  4461	
  4462	"'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,'
  4463	said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my
  4464	room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'
  4465	
  4466	"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to
  4467	step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the
  4468	grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned
  4469	paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I
  4470	glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was
  4471	printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the
  4472	envelope.
  4473	
  4474	"'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave
  4475	my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to
  4476	my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to
  4477	you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you
  4478	cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest
  4479	enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't
  4480	say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper
  4481	where Mr. Fordham shows you.'
  4482	
  4483	"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with
  4484	him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest
  4485	impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every
  4486	way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I
  4487	could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left
  4488	behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed
  4489	and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I
  4490	could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever,
  4491	and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his
  4492	time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the
  4493	inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy
  4494	and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a
  4495	revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man,
  4496	and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by
  4497	man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would
  4498	rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him,
  4499	like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror
  4500	which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen
  4501	his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it
  4502	were new raised from a basin.
  4503	
  4504	"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to
  4505	abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those
  4506	drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when
  4507	we went to search for him, face downward in a little
  4508	green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There
  4509	was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep,
  4510	so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity,
  4511	brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced
  4512	from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself
  4513	that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,
  4514	however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and
  4515	of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank."
  4516	
  4517	"One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee,
  4518	one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me
  4519	have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and
  4520	the date of his supposed suicide."
  4521	
  4522	"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks
  4523	later, upon the night of May 2nd."
  4524	
  4525	"Thank you. Pray proceed."
  4526	
  4527	"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my
  4528	request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been
  4529	always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its
  4530	contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a
  4531	paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and
  4532	'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath.
  4533	These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had
  4534	been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was
  4535	nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many
  4536	scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in
  4537	America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had
  4538	done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.
  4539	Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern
  4540	states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had
  4541	evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag
  4542	politicians who had been sent down from the North.
  4543	
  4544	"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at
  4545	Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the
  4546	January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my
  4547	father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the
  4548	breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened
  4549	envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the
  4550	outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what
  4551	he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked
  4552	very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
  4553	himself.
  4554	
  4555	"'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.
  4556	
  4557	"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.
  4558	
  4559	"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are
  4560	the very letters. But what is this written above them?'
  4561	
  4562	"'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his
  4563	shoulder.
  4564	
  4565	"'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.
  4566	
  4567	"'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the
  4568	papers must be those that are destroyed.'
  4569	
  4570	"'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a
  4571	civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind.
  4572	Where does the thing come from?'
  4573	
  4574	"'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.
  4575	
  4576	"'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do
  4577	with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such
  4578	nonsense.'
  4579	
  4580	"'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.
  4581	
  4582	"'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'
  4583	
  4584	"'Then let me do so?'
  4585	
  4586	"'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such
  4587	nonsense.'
  4588	
  4589	"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate
  4590	man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of
  4591	forebodings.
  4592	
  4593	"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went
  4594	from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is
  4595	in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad
  4596	that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from
  4597	danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in
  4598	error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram
  4599	from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had
  4600	fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the
  4601	neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I
  4602	hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered
  4603	his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from
  4604	Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him,
  4605	and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in
  4606	bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.'
  4607	Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I
  4608	was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of
  4609	murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no
  4610	robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.
  4611	And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease,
  4612	and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been
  4613	woven round him.
  4614	
  4615	"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me
  4616	why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well
  4617	convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an
  4618	incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as
  4619	pressing in one house as in another.
  4620	
  4621	"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two
  4622	years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time
  4623	I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that
  4624	this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended
  4625	with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon,
  4626	however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in
  4627	which it had come upon my father."
  4628	
  4629	The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and
  4630	turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried
  4631	orange pips.
  4632	
  4633	"This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is
  4634	London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were
  4635	upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the
  4636	papers on the sundial.'"
  4637	
  4638	"What have you done?" asked Holmes.
  4639	
  4640	"Nothing."
  4641	
  4642	"Nothing?"
  4643	
  4644	"To tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white
  4645	hands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor
  4646	rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in
  4647	the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight
  4648	and no precautions can guard against."
  4649	
  4650	"Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are
  4651	lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for
  4652	despair."
  4653	
  4654	"I have seen the police."
  4655	
  4656	"Ah!"
  4657	
  4658	"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that
  4659	the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all
  4660	practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really
  4661	accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with
  4662	the warnings."
  4663	
  4664	Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible
  4665	imbecility!" he cried.
  4666	
  4667	"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in
  4668	the house with me."
  4669	
  4670	"Has he come with you to-night?"
  4671	
  4672	"No. His orders were to stay in the house."
  4673	
  4674	Again Holmes raved in the air.
  4675	
  4676	"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you
  4677	not come at once?"
  4678	
  4679	"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major
  4680	Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to
  4681	you."
  4682	
  4683	"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have
  4684	acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than
  4685	that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which
  4686	might help us?"
  4687	
  4688	"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat
  4689	pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted
  4690	paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance,"
  4691	said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I
  4692	observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the
  4693	ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet
  4694	upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it
  4695	may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from
  4696	among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond
  4697	the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think
  4698	myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is
  4699	undoubtedly my uncle's."
  4700	
  4701	Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper,
  4702	which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from
  4703	a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the
  4704	following enigmatical notices:
  4705	
  4706	"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.
  4707	
  4708	"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and
  4709	      John Swain, of St. Augustine.
  4710	
  4711	"9th. McCauley cleared.
  4712	
  4713	"10th. John Swain cleared.
  4714	
  4715	"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."
  4716	
  4717	"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it
  4718	to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another
  4719	instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told
  4720	me. You must get home instantly and act."
  4721	
  4722	"What shall I do?"
  4723	
  4724	"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must
  4725	put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass
  4726	box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say
  4727	that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that
  4728	this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such
  4729	words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you
  4730	must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do
  4731	you understand?"
  4732	
  4733	"Entirely."
  4734	
  4735	"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I
  4736	think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our
  4737	web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first
  4738	consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens
  4739	you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the
  4740	guilty parties."
  4741	
  4742	"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his
  4743	overcoat. "You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall
  4744	certainly do as you advise."
  4745	
  4746	"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in
  4747	the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that
  4748	you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you
  4749	go back?"
  4750	
  4751	"By train from Waterloo."
  4752	
  4753	"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that
  4754	you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too
  4755	closely."
  4756	
  4757	"I am armed."
  4758	
  4759	"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."
  4760	
  4761	"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"
  4762	
  4763	"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek
  4764	it."
  4765	
  4766	"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news
  4767	as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every
  4768	particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside
  4769	the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered
  4770	against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come
  4771	to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet
  4772	of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them
  4773	once more.
  4774	
  4775	Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk
  4776	forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he
  4777	lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue
  4778	smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.
  4779	
  4780	"I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we
  4781	have had none more fantastic than this."
  4782	
  4783	"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."
  4784	
  4785	"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems
  4786	to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the
  4787	Sholtos."
  4788	
  4789	"But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to
  4790	what these perils are?"
  4791	
  4792	"There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.
  4793	
  4794	"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue
  4795	this unhappy family?"
  4796	
  4797	Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the
  4798	arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal
  4799	reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a
  4800	single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the
  4801	chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which
  4802	would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole
  4803	animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who
  4804	has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents
  4805	should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both
  4806	before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the
  4807	reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study
  4808	which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the
  4809	aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest
  4810	pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to
  4811	utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this
  4812	in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all
  4813	knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and
  4814	encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so
  4815	impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge
  4816	which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have
  4817	endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one
  4818	occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits
  4819	in a very precise fashion."
  4820	
  4821	"Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document.
  4822	Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I
  4823	remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the
  4824	mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry
  4825	eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime
  4826	records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and
  4827	self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the
  4828	main points of my analysis."
  4829	
  4830	Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as
  4831	I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic
  4832	stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the
  4833	rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he
  4834	can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which
  4835	has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster
  4836	all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the
  4837	'American Encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you.
  4838	Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be
  4839	deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong
  4840	presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for
  4841	leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their
  4842	habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for
  4843	the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love
  4844	of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of
  4845	someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis
  4846	that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from
  4847	America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by
  4848	considering the formidable letters which were received by himself
  4849	and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those
  4850	letters?"
  4851	
  4852	"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the
  4853	third from London."
  4854	
  4855	"From East London. What do you deduce from that?"
  4856	
  4857	"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."
  4858	
  4859	"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that
  4860	the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was
  4861	on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the
  4862	case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and
  4863	its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days.
  4864	Does that suggest anything?"
  4865	
  4866	"A greater distance to travel."
  4867	
  4868	"But the letter had also a greater distance to come."
  4869	
  4870	"Then I do not see the point."
  4871	
  4872	"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man
  4873	or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send
  4874	their singular warning or token before them when starting upon
  4875	their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign
  4876	when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a
  4877	steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.
  4878	But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those
  4879	seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which
  4880	brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the
  4881	writer."
  4882	
  4883	"It is possible."
  4884	
  4885	"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly
  4886	urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to
  4887	caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which
  4888	it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one
  4889	comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."
  4890	
  4891	"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless
  4892	persecution?"
  4893	
  4894	"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital
  4895	importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think
  4896	that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.
  4897	A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way
  4898	as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in
  4899	it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.
  4900	Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.
  4901	In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an
  4902	individual and becomes the badge of a society."
  4903	
  4904	"But of what society?"
  4905	
  4906	"Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and
  4907	sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"
  4908	
  4909	"I never have."
  4910	
  4911	Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it
  4912	is," said he presently:
  4913	
  4914	"'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to
  4915	the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret
  4916	society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the
  4917	Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local
  4918	branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,
  4919	Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was
  4920	used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of
  4921	the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country
  4922	of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually
  4923	preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
  4924	but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some
  4925	parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this
  4926	the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might
  4927	fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would
  4928	unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and
  4929	unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the
  4930	society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a
  4931	case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with
  4932	impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the
  4933	perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite
  4934	of the efforts of the United States government and of the better
  4935	classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year
  4936	1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have
  4937	been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'
  4938	
  4939	"You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that
  4940	the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the
  4941	disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may
  4942	well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his
  4943	family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.
  4944	You can understand that this register and diary may implicate
  4945	some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many
  4946	who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."
  4947	
  4948	"Then the page we have seen--"
  4949	
  4950	"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent
  4951	the pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to
  4952	them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or
  4953	left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a
  4954	sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let
  4955	some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only
  4956	chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have
  4957	told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done
  4958	to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for
  4959	half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable
  4960	ways of our fellow-men."
  4961	
  4962	
  4963	It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a
  4964	subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the
  4965	great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came
  4966	down.
  4967	
  4968	"You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I
  4969	foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of
  4970	young Openshaw's."
  4971	
  4972	"What steps will you take?" I asked.
  4973	
  4974	"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries.
  4975	I may have to go down to Horsham, after all."
  4976	
  4977	"You will not go there first?"
  4978	
  4979	"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the
  4980	maid will bring up your coffee."
  4981	
  4982	As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and
  4983	glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a
  4984	chill to my heart.
  4985	
  4986	"Holmes," I cried, "you are too late."
  4987	
  4988	"Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it
  4989	done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.
  4990	
  4991	"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy
  4992	Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the account:
  4993	
  4994	"Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H
  4995	Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and
  4996	a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and
  4997	stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it
  4998	was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was
  4999	given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was
  5000	eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman
  5001	whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his
  5002	pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.
  5003	It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch
  5004	the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and
  5005	the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge
  5006	of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body
  5007	exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that
  5008	the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident,
  5009	which should have the effect of calling the attention of the
  5010	authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages."
  5011	
  5012	We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and
  5013	shaken than I had ever seen him.
  5014	
  5015	"That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty
  5016	feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal
  5017	matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my
  5018	hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that
  5019	I should send him away to his death--!" He sprang from his chair
  5020	and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a
  5021	flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and
  5022	unclasping of his long thin hands.
  5023	
  5024	"They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could
  5025	they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the
  5026	direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too
  5027	crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson,
  5028	we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"
  5029	
  5030	"To the police?"
  5031	
  5032	"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may
  5033	take the flies, but not before."
  5034	
  5035	All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in
  5036	the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes
  5037	had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he
  5038	entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard,
  5039	and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously,
  5040	washing it down with a long draught of water.
  5041	
  5042	"You are hungry," I remarked.
  5043	
  5044	"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since
  5045	breakfast."
  5046	
  5047	"Nothing?"
  5048	
  5049	"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."
  5050	
  5051	"And how have you succeeded?"
  5052	
  5053	"Well."
  5054	
  5055	"You have a clue?"
  5056	
  5057	"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not
  5058	long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish
  5059	trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!"
  5060	
  5061	"What do you mean?"
  5062	
  5063	He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he
  5064	squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and
  5065	thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote
  5066	"S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain
  5067	James Calhoun, Barque 'Lone Star,' Savannah, Georgia."
  5068	
  5069	"That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling.
  5070	"It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a
  5071	precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."
  5072	
  5073	"And who is this Captain Calhoun?"
  5074	
  5075	"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."
  5076	
  5077	"How did you trace it, then?"
  5078	
  5079	He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with
  5080	dates and names.
  5081	
  5082	"I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers
  5083	and files of the old papers, following the future career of every
  5084	vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in
  5085	'83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were
  5086	reported there during those months. Of these, one, the 'Lone Star,'
  5087	instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported
  5088	as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to
  5089	one of the states of the Union."
  5090	
  5091	"Texas, I think."
  5092	
  5093	"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must
  5094	have an American origin."
  5095	
  5096	"What then?"
  5097	
  5098	"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque
  5099	'Lone Star' was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a
  5100	certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present
  5101	in the port of London."
  5102	
  5103	"Yes?"
  5104	
  5105	"The 'Lone Star' had arrived here last week. I went down to the
  5106	Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by
  5107	the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired
  5108	to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and
  5109	as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the
  5110	Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight."
  5111	
  5112	"What will you do, then?"
  5113	
  5114	"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I
  5115	learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are
  5116	Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away
  5117	from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has
  5118	been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship
  5119	reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and
  5120	the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these
  5121	three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder."
  5122	
  5123	There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans,
  5124	and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the
  5125	orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as
  5126	resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very
  5127	severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for
  5128	news of the "Lone Star" of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We
  5129	did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a
  5130	shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough
  5131	of a wave, with the letters "L. S." carved upon it, and that is
  5132	all which we shall ever know of the fate of the "Lone Star."
  5133	
  5134	
  5135	
  5136	ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
  5137	
  5138	Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal
  5139	of the Theological College of St. George's, was much addicted to
  5140	opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some
  5141	foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De
  5142	Quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had
  5143	drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the
  5144	same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the
  5145	practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many
  5146	years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of
  5147	mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see
  5148	him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point
  5149	pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble
  5150	man.
  5151	
  5152	One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell,
  5153	about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the
  5154	clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work
  5155	down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.
  5156	
  5157	"A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."
  5158	
  5159	I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.
  5160	
  5161	We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps
  5162	upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in
  5163	some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.
  5164	
  5165	"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then,
  5166	suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms
  5167	about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in
  5168	such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."
  5169	
  5170	"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney.
  5171	How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when
  5172	you came in."
  5173	
  5174	"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was
  5175	always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds
  5176	to a light-house.
  5177	
  5178	"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine
  5179	and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or
  5180	should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"
  5181	
  5182	"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about
  5183	Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about
  5184	him!"
  5185	
  5186	It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her
  5187	husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend
  5188	and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words
  5189	as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it
  5190	possible that we could bring him back to her?
  5191	
  5192	It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late
  5193	he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the
  5194	farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been
  5195	confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and
  5196	shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him
  5197	eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the
  5198	dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the
  5199	effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar
  5200	of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could
  5201	she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and
  5202	pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?
  5203	
  5204	There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of
  5205	it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second
  5206	thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical
  5207	adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it
  5208	better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would
  5209	send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the
  5210	address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left
  5211	my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding
  5212	eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at
  5213	the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to
  5214	be.
  5215	
  5216	But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my
  5217	adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the
  5218	high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east
  5219	of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached
  5220	by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the
  5221	mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search.
  5222	Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in
  5223	the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the
  5224	light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch
  5225	and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the
  5226	brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the
  5227	forecastle of an emigrant ship.
  5228	
  5229	Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying
  5230	in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads
  5231	thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a
  5232	dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black
  5233	shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright,
  5234	now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of
  5235	the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to
  5236	themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low,
  5237	monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then
  5238	suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own
  5239	thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At
  5240	the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside
  5241	which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old
  5242	man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon
  5243	his knees, staring into the fire.
  5244	
  5245	As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe
  5246	for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
  5247	
  5248	"Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend
  5249	of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."
  5250	
  5251	There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and
  5252	peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and
  5253	unkempt, staring out at me.
  5254	
  5255	"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of
  5256	reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what
  5257	o'clock is it?"
  5258	
  5259	"Nearly eleven."
  5260	
  5261	"Of what day?"
  5262	
  5263	"Of Friday, June 19th."
  5264	
  5265	"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What
  5266	d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his
  5267	arms and began to sob in a high treble key.
  5268	
  5269	"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting
  5270	this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
  5271	
  5272	"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here
  5273	a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll
  5274	go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate.
  5275	Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"
  5276	
  5277	"Yes, I have one waiting."
  5278	
  5279	"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I
  5280	owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."
  5281	
  5282	I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of
  5283	sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying
  5284	fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed
  5285	the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my
  5286	skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me, and then look
  5287	back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I
  5288	glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my
  5289	side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very
  5290	wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between
  5291	his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his
  5292	fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my
  5293	self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of
  5294	astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him
  5295	but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull
  5296	eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and
  5297	grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He
  5298	made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he
  5299	turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided
  5300	into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.
  5301	
  5302	"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"
  5303	
  5304	"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you
  5305	would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend
  5306	of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with
  5307	you."
  5308	
  5309	"I have a cab outside."
  5310	
  5311	"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he
  5312	appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should
  5313	recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to
  5314	say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait
  5315	outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."
  5316	
  5317	It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for
  5318	they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with
  5319	such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney
  5320	was once confined in the cab my mission was practically
  5321	accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better
  5322	than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular
  5323	adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a
  5324	few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him
  5325	out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a
  5326	very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den,
  5327	and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two
  5328	streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.
  5329	Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and
  5330	burst into a hearty fit of laughter.
  5331	
  5332	"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added
  5333	opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little
  5334	weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical
  5335	views."
  5336	
  5337	"I was certainly surprised to find you there."
  5338	
  5339	"But not more so than I to find you."
  5340	
  5341	"I came to find a friend."
  5342	
  5343	"And I to find an enemy."
  5344	
  5345	"An enemy?"
  5346	
  5347	"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural
  5348	prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable
  5349	inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent
  5350	ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been
  5351	recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an
  5352	hour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own
  5353	purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have
  5354	vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that
  5355	building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some
  5356	strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless
  5357	nights."
  5358	
  5359	"What! You do not mean bodies?"
  5360	
  5361	"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds
  5362	for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It
  5363	is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that
  5364	Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our
  5365	trap should be here." He put his two forefingers between his
  5366	teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a
  5367	similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle
  5368	of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.
  5369	
  5370	"Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through
  5371	the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from
  5372	its side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"
  5373	
  5374	"If I can be of use."
  5375	
  5376	"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still
  5377	more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."
  5378	
  5379	"The Cedars?"
  5380	
  5381	"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I
  5382	conduct the inquiry."
  5383	
  5384	"Where is it, then?"
  5385	
  5386	"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us."
  5387	
  5388	"But I am all in the dark."
  5389	
  5390	"Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up
  5391	here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a
  5392	crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her
  5393	head. So long, then!"
  5394	
  5395	He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through
  5396	the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which
  5397	widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad
  5398	balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly
  5399	beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and
  5400	mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of
  5401	the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of
  5402	revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a
  5403	star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of
  5404	the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his
  5405	breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat
  5406	beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which
  5407	seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in
  5408	upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles,
  5409	and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban
  5410	villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up
  5411	his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he
  5412	is acting for the best.
  5413	
  5414	"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes
  5415	you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great
  5416	thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are
  5417	not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear
  5418	little woman to-night when she meets me at the door."
  5419	
  5420	"You forget that I know nothing about it."
  5421	
  5422	"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before
  5423	we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can
  5424	get nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I
  5425	can't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case
  5426	clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a
  5427	spark where all is dark to me."
  5428	
  5429	"Proceed, then."
  5430	
  5431	"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee
  5432	a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have
  5433	plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very
  5434	nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made
  5435	friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter
  5436	of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no
  5437	occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into
  5438	town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon
  5439	Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of
  5440	age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very
  5441	affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know
  5442	him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far
  5443	as we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while
  5444	he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and
  5445	Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money
  5446	troubles have been weighing upon his mind.
  5447	
  5448	"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier
  5449	than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important
  5450	commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy
  5451	home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife
  5452	received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his
  5453	departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable
  5454	value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the
  5455	offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up
  5456	in your London, you will know that the office of the company is
  5457	in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where
  5458	you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for
  5459	the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office,
  5460	got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through
  5461	Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me
  5462	so far?"
  5463	
  5464	"It is very clear."
  5465	
  5466	"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.
  5467	Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab,
  5468	as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself.
  5469	While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly
  5470	heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her
  5471	husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning
  5472	to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she
  5473	distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly
  5474	agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then
  5475	vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that
  5476	he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind.
  5477	One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that
  5478	although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town
  5479	in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.
  5480	
  5481	"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the
  5482	steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which
  5483	you found me to-night--and running through the front room she
  5484	attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At
  5485	the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of
  5486	whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who
  5487	acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled
  5488	with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the
  5489	lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of
  5490	constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The
  5491	inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the
  5492	continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to
  5493	the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no
  5494	sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was
  5495	no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,
  5496	it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly
  5497	swore that no one else had been in the front room during the
  5498	afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was
  5499	staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had
  5500	been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box
  5501	which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell
  5502	a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had
  5503	promised to bring home.
  5504	
  5505	"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple
  5506	showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious.
  5507	The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an
  5508	abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a
  5509	sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon
  5510	the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom
  5511	window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered
  5512	at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The
  5513	bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On
  5514	examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill,
  5515	and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of
  5516	the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were
  5517	all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of
  5518	his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were
  5519	there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these
  5520	garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St.
  5521	Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no
  5522	other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon
  5523	the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by
  5524	swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of
  5525	the tragedy.
  5526	
  5527	"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately
  5528	implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the
  5529	vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was
  5530	known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few
  5531	seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could
  5532	hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence
  5533	was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no
  5534	knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he
  5535	could not account in any way for the presence of the missing
  5536	gentleman's clothes.
  5537	
  5538	"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who
  5539	lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was
  5540	certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.
  5541	Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which
  5542	is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a
  5543	professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police
  5544	regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some
  5545	little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand
  5546	side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the
  5547	wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,
  5548	cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he
  5549	is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the
  5550	greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I
  5551	have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of
  5552	making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised
  5553	at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His
  5554	appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him
  5555	without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face
  5556	disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has
  5557	turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a
  5558	pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular
  5559	contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid
  5560	the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he
  5561	is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be
  5562	thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now
  5563	learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been
  5564	the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."
  5565	
  5566	"But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed
  5567	against a man in the prime of life?"
  5568	
  5569	"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in
  5570	other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.
  5571	Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that
  5572	weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional
  5573	strength in the others."
  5574	
  5575	"Pray continue your narrative."
  5576	
  5577	"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the
  5578	window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her
  5579	presence could be of no help to them in their investigations.
  5580	Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful
  5581	examination of the premises, but without finding anything which
  5582	threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not
  5583	arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes
  5584	during which he might have communicated with his friend the
  5585	Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and
  5586	searched, without anything being found which could incriminate
  5587	him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right
  5588	shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been
  5589	cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from
  5590	there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and
  5591	that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from
  5592	the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr.
  5593	Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in
  5594	his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to
  5595	Mrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband
  5596	at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or
  5597	dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the
  5598	police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in
  5599	the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.
  5600	
  5601	"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they
  5602	had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not
  5603	Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And
  5604	what do you think they found in the pockets?"
  5605	
  5606	"I cannot imagine."
  5607	
  5608	"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with
  5609	pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It
  5610	was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a
  5611	human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between
  5612	the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the
  5613	weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked
  5614	away into the river."
  5615	
  5616	"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the
  5617	room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"
  5618	
  5619	"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose
  5620	that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the
  5621	window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.
  5622	What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him
  5623	that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize
  5624	the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it
  5625	would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little
  5626	time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried
  5627	to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his
  5628	Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.
  5629	There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret
  5630	hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he
  5631	stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the
  5632	pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and
  5633	would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard
  5634	the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the
  5635	window when the police appeared."
  5636	
  5637	"It certainly sounds feasible."
  5638	
  5639	"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a
  5640	better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the
  5641	station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before
  5642	been anything against him. He had for years been known as a
  5643	professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very
  5644	quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and
  5645	the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was
  5646	doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is
  5647	he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are
  5648	all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot
  5649	recall any case within my experience which looked at the first
  5650	glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."
  5651	
  5652	While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of
  5653	events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great
  5654	town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and
  5655	we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us.
  5656	Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered
  5657	villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.
  5658	
  5659	"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have
  5660	touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in
  5661	Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.
  5662	See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside
  5663	that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have
  5664	little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."
  5665	
  5666	"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I
  5667	asked.
  5668	
  5669	"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.
  5670	Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and
  5671	you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for
  5672	my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have
  5673	no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"
  5674	
  5675	We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its
  5676	own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and
  5677	springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding
  5678	gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door
  5679	flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad
  5680	in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy
  5681	pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure
  5682	outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one
  5683	half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head
  5684	and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing
  5685	question.
  5686	
  5687	"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two
  5688	of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw
  5689	that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
  5690	
  5691	"No good news?"
  5692	
  5693	"None."
  5694	
  5695	"No bad?"
  5696	
  5697	"No."
  5698	
  5699	"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have
  5700	had a long day."
  5701	
  5702	"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to
  5703	me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it
  5704	possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this
  5705	investigation."
  5706	
  5707	"I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly.
  5708	"You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our
  5709	arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so
  5710	suddenly upon us."
  5711	
  5712	"My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were
  5713	not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of
  5714	any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be
  5715	indeed happy."
  5716	
  5717	"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady as we entered a
  5718	well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had
  5719	been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two
  5720	plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain
  5721	answer."
  5722	
  5723	"Certainly, madam."
  5724	
  5725	"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given
  5726	to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."
  5727	
  5728	"Upon what point?"
  5729	
  5730	"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"
  5731	
  5732	Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.
  5733	"Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking
  5734	keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
  5735	
  5736	"Frankly, then, madam, I do not."
  5737	
  5738	"You think that he is dead?"
  5739	
  5740	"I do."
  5741	
  5742	"Murdered?"
  5743	
  5744	"I don't say that. Perhaps."
  5745	
  5746	"And on what day did he meet his death?"
  5747	
  5748	"On Monday."
  5749	
  5750	"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how
  5751	it is that I have received a letter from him to-day."
  5752	
  5753	Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been
  5754	galvanised.
  5755	
  5756	"What!" he roared.
  5757	
  5758	"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of
  5759	paper in the air.
  5760	
  5761	"May I see it?"
  5762	
  5763	"Certainly."
  5764	
  5765	He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out
  5766	upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I
  5767	had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The
  5768	envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend
  5769	postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day
  5770	before, for it was considerably after midnight.
  5771	
  5772	"Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your
  5773	husband's writing, madam."
  5774	
  5775	"No, but the enclosure is."
  5776	
  5777	"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go
  5778	and inquire as to the address."
  5779	
  5780	"How can you tell that?"
  5781	
  5782	"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried
  5783	itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that
  5784	blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight
  5785	off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This
  5786	man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before
  5787	he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not
  5788	familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is
  5789	nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!
  5790	there has been an enclosure here!"
  5791	
  5792	"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."
  5793	
  5794	"And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?"
  5795	
  5796	"One of his hands."
  5797	
  5798	"One?"
  5799	
  5800	"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual
  5801	writing, and yet I know it well."
  5802	
  5803	"'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a
  5804	huge error which it may take some little time to rectify.
  5805	Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf
  5806	of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in
  5807	Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been
  5808	gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been
  5809	chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband's
  5810	hand, madam?"
  5811	
  5812	"None. Neville wrote those words."
  5813	
  5814	"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair,
  5815	the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the
  5816	danger is over."
  5817	
  5818	"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."
  5819	
  5820	"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.
  5821	The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from
  5822	him."
  5823	
  5824	"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"
  5825	
  5826	"Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only
  5827	posted to-day."
  5828	
  5829	"That is possible."
  5830	
  5831	"If so, much may have happened between."
  5832	
  5833	"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is
  5834	well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I
  5835	should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him
  5836	last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room
  5837	rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that
  5838	something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such
  5839	a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"
  5840	
  5841	"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman
  5842	may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical
  5843	reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong
  5844	piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband
  5845	is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away
  5846	from you?"
  5847	
  5848	"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."
  5849	
  5850	"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?"
  5851	
  5852	"No."
  5853	
  5854	"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?"
  5855	
  5856	"Very much so."
  5857	
  5858	"Was the window open?"
  5859	
  5860	"Yes."
  5861	
  5862	"Then he might have called to you?"
  5863	
  5864	"He might."
  5865	
  5866	"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?"
  5867	
  5868	"Yes."
  5869	
  5870	"A call for help, you thought?"
  5871	
  5872	"Yes. He waved his hands."
  5873	
  5874	"But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the
  5875	unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"
  5876	
  5877	"It is possible."
  5878	
  5879	"And you thought he was pulled back?"
  5880	
  5881	"He disappeared so suddenly."
  5882	
  5883	"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the
  5884	room?"
  5885	
  5886	"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and
  5887	the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs."
  5888	
  5889	"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his
  5890	ordinary clothes on?"
  5891	
  5892	"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare
  5893	throat."
  5894	
  5895	"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"
  5896	
  5897	"Never."
  5898	
  5899	"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?"
  5900	
  5901	"Never."
  5902	
  5903	"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about
  5904	which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little
  5905	supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day
  5906	to-morrow."
  5907	
  5908	A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our
  5909	disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary
  5910	after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however,
  5911	who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for
  5912	days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over,
  5913	rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view
  5914	until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his
  5915	data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now
  5916	preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and
  5917	waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered
  5918	about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from
  5919	the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of
  5920	Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with
  5921	an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front
  5922	of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an
  5923	old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the
  5924	corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him,
  5925	silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set
  5926	aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he
  5927	sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found
  5928	the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still
  5929	between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was
  5930	full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of
  5931	shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
  5932	
  5933	"Awake, Watson?" he asked.
  5934	
  5935	"Yes."
  5936	
  5937	"Game for a morning drive?"
  5938	
  5939	"Certainly."
  5940	
  5941	"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the
  5942	stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He
  5943	chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed
  5944	a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.
  5945	
  5946	As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one
  5947	was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly
  5948	finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was
  5949	putting in the horse.
  5950	
  5951	"I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his
  5952	boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the
  5953	presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve
  5954	to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the
  5955	key of the affair now."
  5956	
  5957	"And where is it?" I asked, smiling.
  5958	
  5959	"In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he
  5960	continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been
  5961	there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this
  5962	Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will
  5963	not fit the lock."
  5964	
  5965	We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into
  5966	the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and
  5967	trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both
  5968	sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country
  5969	carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but
  5970	the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as
  5971	some city in a dream.
  5972	
  5973	"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes,
  5974	flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been
  5975	as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than
  5976	never to learn it at all."
  5977	
  5978	In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily
  5979	from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey
  5980	side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the
  5981	river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the
  5982	right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well
  5983	known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted
  5984	him. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.
  5985	
  5986	"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.
  5987	
  5988	"Inspector Bradstreet, sir."
  5989	
  5990	"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come
  5991	down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged
  5992	jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet."
  5993	"Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small,
  5994	office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a
  5995	telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his
  5996	desk.
  5997	
  5998	"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"
  5999	
  6000	"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged
  6001	with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St.
  6002	Clair, of Lee."
  6003	
  6004	"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."
  6005	
  6006	"So I heard. You have him here?"
  6007	
  6008	"In the cells."
  6009	
  6010	"Is he quiet?"
  6011	
  6012	"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."
  6013	
  6014	"Dirty?"
  6015	
  6016	"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his
  6017	face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been
  6018	settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you
  6019	saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."
  6020	
  6021	"I should like to see him very much."
  6022	
  6023	"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave
  6024	your bag."
  6025	
  6026	"No, I think that I'll take it."
  6027	
  6028	"Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a
  6029	passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and
  6030	brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each
  6031	side.
  6032	
  6033	"The third on the right is his," said the inspector. "Here it
  6034	is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door
  6035	and glanced through.
  6036	
  6037	"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."
  6038	
  6039	We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his
  6040	face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and
  6041	heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his
  6042	calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his
  6043	tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely
  6044	dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its
  6045	repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right
  6046	across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up
  6047	one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a
  6048	perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over
  6049	his eyes and forehead.
  6050	
  6051	"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.
  6052	
  6053	"He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that
  6054	he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me."
  6055	He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my
  6056	astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.
  6057	
  6058	"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.
  6059	
  6060	"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
  6061	quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable
  6062	figure."
  6063	
  6064	"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't
  6065	look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his
  6066	key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The
  6067	sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep
  6068	slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge,
  6069	and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the
  6070	prisoner's face.
  6071	
  6072	"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of
  6073	Lee, in the county of Kent."
  6074	
  6075	Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled
  6076	off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the
  6077	coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had
  6078	seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the
  6079	repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled
  6080	red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale,
  6081	sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned,
  6082	rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.
  6083	Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and
  6084	threw himself down with his face to the pillow.
  6085	
  6086	"Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing
  6087	man. I know him from the photograph."
  6088	
  6089	The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons
  6090	himself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I
  6091	charged with?"
  6092	
  6093	"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be
  6094	charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of
  6095	it," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been
  6096	twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."
  6097	
  6098	"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime
  6099	has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally
  6100	detained."
  6101	
  6102	"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said
  6103	Holmes. "You would have done better to have trusted you wife."
  6104	
  6105	"It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner.
  6106	"God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My
  6107	God! What an exposure! What can I do?"
  6108	
  6109	Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him
  6110	kindly on the shoulder.
  6111	
  6112	"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said
  6113	he, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand,
  6114	if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible
  6115	case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the
  6116	details should find their way into the papers. Inspector
  6117	Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you
  6118	might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case
  6119	would then never go into court at all."
  6120	
  6121	"God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have
  6122	endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left
  6123	my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.
  6124	
  6125	"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a
  6126	schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent
  6127	education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and
  6128	finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day
  6129	my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the
  6130	metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point
  6131	from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying
  6132	begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to
  6133	base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the
  6134	secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for
  6135	my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my
  6136	face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good
  6137	scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a
  6138	small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of
  6139	hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business
  6140	part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a
  6141	beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned
  6142	home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no
  6143	less than 26s. 4d.
  6144	
  6145	"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until,
  6146	some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ
  6147	served upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit's end where to get
  6148	the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's
  6149	grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers,
  6150	and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In
  6151	ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.
  6152	
  6153	"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous
  6154	work at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in
  6155	a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on
  6156	the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my
  6157	pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up
  6158	reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first
  6159	chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets
  6160	with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a
  6161	low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could
  6162	every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings
  6163	transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow,
  6164	a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that
  6165	my secret was safe in his possession.
  6166	
  6167	"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of
  6168	money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London
  6169	could earn 700 pounds a year--which is less than my average
  6170	takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making
  6171	up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by
  6172	practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City.
  6173	All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,
  6174	and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.
  6175	
  6176	"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the
  6177	country, and eventually married, without anyone having a
  6178	suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had
  6179	business in the City. She little knew what.
  6180	
  6181	"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my
  6182	room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw,
  6183	to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the
  6184	street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of
  6185	surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my
  6186	confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from
  6187	coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that
  6188	she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on
  6189	those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's
  6190	eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it
  6191	occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that
  6192	the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening
  6193	by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in
  6194	the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was
  6195	weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from
  6196	the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of
  6197	the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes
  6198	would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of
  6199	constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,
  6200	I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.
  6201	Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.
  6202	
  6203	"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I
  6204	was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and
  6205	hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would
  6206	be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the
  6207	Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together
  6208	with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to
  6209	fear."
  6210	
  6211	"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.
  6212	
  6213	"Good God! What a week she must have spent!"
  6214	
  6215	"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet,
  6216	"and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to
  6217	post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor
  6218	customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."
  6219	
  6220	"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt
  6221	of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"
  6222	
  6223	"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"
  6224	
  6225	"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are
  6226	to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."
  6227	
  6228	"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."
  6229	
  6230	"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps
  6231	may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out.
  6232	I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for
  6233	having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your
  6234	results."
  6235	
  6236	"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five
  6237	pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if
  6238	we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."
  6239	
  6240	
  6241	
  6242	VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
  6243	
  6244	I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second
  6245	morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the
  6246	compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a
  6247	purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the
  6248	right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly
  6249	studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and
  6250	on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable
  6251	hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several
  6252	places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
  6253	suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
  6254	purpose of examination.
  6255	
  6256	"You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."
  6257	
  6258	"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss
  6259	my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his
  6260	thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there are points in
  6261	connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and
  6262	even of instruction."
  6263	
  6264	I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his
  6265	crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows
  6266	were thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that,
  6267	homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to
  6268	it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of
  6269	some mystery and the punishment of some crime."
  6270	
  6271	"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of
  6272	those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have
  6273	four million human beings all jostling each other within the
  6274	space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so
  6275	dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events
  6276	may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be
  6277	presented which may be striking and bizarre without being
  6278	criminal. We have already had experience of such."
  6279	
  6280	"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I
  6281	have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any
  6282	legal crime."
  6283	
  6284	"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler
  6285	papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the
  6286	adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt
  6287	that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.
  6288	You know Peterson, the commissionaire?"
  6289	
  6290	"Yes."
  6291	
  6292	"It is to him that this trophy belongs."
  6293	
  6294	"It is his hat."
  6295	
  6296	"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will
  6297	look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual
  6298	problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon
  6299	Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I
  6300	have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's
  6301	fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas
  6302	morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was
  6303	returning from some small jollification and was making his way
  6304	homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in
  6305	the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and
  6306	carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the
  6307	corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger
  6308	and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the
  6309	man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and,
  6310	swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.
  6311	Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his
  6312	assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and
  6313	seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him,
  6314	dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the
  6315	labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham
  6316	Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of
  6317	Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of
  6318	battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this
  6319	battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."
  6320	
  6321	"Which surely he restored to their owner?"
  6322	
  6323	"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For
  6324	Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to
  6325	the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H.
  6326	B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are
  6327	some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in
  6328	this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any
  6329	one of them."
  6330	
  6331	"What, then, did Peterson do?"
  6332	
  6333	"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,
  6334	knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.
  6335	The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs
  6336	that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it
  6337	should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried
  6338	it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose,
  6339	while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who
  6340	lost his Christmas dinner."
  6341	
  6342	"Did he not advertise?"
  6343	
  6344	"No."
  6345	
  6346	"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?"
  6347	
  6348	"Only as much as we can deduce."
  6349	
  6350	"From his hat?"
  6351	
  6352	"Precisely."
  6353	
  6354	"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered
  6355	felt?"
  6356	
  6357	"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather
  6358	yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this
  6359	article?"
  6360	
  6361	I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
  6362	ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round
  6363	shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of
  6364	red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's
  6365	name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were
  6366	scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a
  6367	hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was
  6368	cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places,
  6369	although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
  6370	discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.
  6371	
  6372	"I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.
  6373	
  6374	"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail,
  6375	however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in
  6376	drawing your inferences."
  6377	
  6378	"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"
  6379	
  6380	He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective
  6381	fashion which was characteristic of him. "It is perhaps less
  6382	suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there
  6383	are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others
  6384	which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That
  6385	the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the
  6386	face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the
  6387	last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He
  6388	had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a
  6389	moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his
  6390	fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,
  6391	at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that
  6392	his wife has ceased to love him."
  6393	
  6394	"My dear Holmes!"
  6395	
  6396	"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he
  6397	continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a
  6398	sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is
  6399	middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the
  6400	last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are
  6401	the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also,
  6402	by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid
  6403	on in his house."
  6404	
  6405	"You are certainly joking, Holmes."
  6406	
  6407	"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you
  6408	these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"
  6409	
  6410	"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I
  6411	am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that
  6412	this man was intellectual?"
  6413	
  6414	For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right
  6415	over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is
  6416	a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a
  6417	brain must have something in it."
  6418	
  6419	"The decline of his fortunes, then?"
  6420	
  6421	"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge
  6422	came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the
  6423	band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could
  6424	afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no
  6425	hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."
  6426	
  6427	"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the
  6428	foresight and the moral retrogression?"
  6429	
  6430	Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he putting
  6431	his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.
  6432	"They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a
  6433	sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his
  6434	way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see
  6435	that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace
  6436	it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly,
  6437	which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other
  6438	hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the
  6439	felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not
  6440	entirely lost his self-respect."
  6441	
  6442	"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."
  6443	
  6444	"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is
  6445	grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses
  6446	lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the
  6447	lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of
  6448	hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all
  6449	appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of
  6450	lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey
  6451	dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,
  6452	showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while
  6453	the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the
  6454	wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in
  6455	the best of training."
  6456	
  6457	"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."
  6458	
  6459	"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear
  6460	Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and
  6461	when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear
  6462	that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's
  6463	affection."
  6464	
  6465	"But he might be a bachelor."
  6466	
  6467	"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his
  6468	wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg."
  6469	
  6470	"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce
  6471	that the gas is not laid on in his house?"
  6472	
  6473	"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I
  6474	see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt
  6475	that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with
  6476	burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in
  6477	one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never
  6478	got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"
  6479	
  6480	"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as
  6481	you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm
  6482	done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a
  6483	waste of energy."
  6484	
  6485	Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew
  6486	open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment
  6487	with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with
  6488	astonishment.
  6489	
  6490	"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.
  6491	
  6492	"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off
  6493	through the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon
  6494	the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.
  6495	
  6496	"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out
  6497	his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly
  6498	scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but
  6499	of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric
  6500	point in the dark hollow of his hand.
  6501	
  6502	Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said
  6503	he, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you
  6504	have got?"
  6505	
  6506	"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though
  6507	it were putty."
  6508	
  6509	"It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone."
  6510	
  6511	"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.
  6512	
  6513	"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I
  6514	have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day
  6515	lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be
  6516	conjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly
  6517	not within a twentieth part of the market price."
  6518	
  6519	"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire
  6520	plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.
  6521	
  6522	"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are
  6523	sentimental considerations in the background which would induce
  6524	the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but
  6525	recover the gem."
  6526	
  6527	"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," I
  6528	remarked.
  6529	
  6530	"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner,
  6531	a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's
  6532	jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case
  6533	has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the
  6534	matter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers,
  6535	glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out,
  6536	doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:
  6537	
  6538	"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was
  6539	brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst.,
  6540	abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the
  6541	valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder,
  6542	upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect
  6543	that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess
  6544	of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might
  6545	solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had
  6546	remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been
  6547	called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared,
  6548	that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco
  6549	casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was
  6550	accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the
  6551	dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was
  6552	arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found
  6553	either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to
  6554	the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on
  6555	discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,
  6556	where she found matters as described by the last witness.
  6557	Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest
  6558	of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence
  6559	in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for
  6560	robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate
  6561	refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to
  6562	the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion
  6563	during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was
  6564	carried out of court."
  6565	
  6566	"Hum! So much for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully,
  6567	tossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the
  6568	sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to
  6569	the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You
  6570	see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much
  6571	more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the
  6572	stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry
  6573	Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other
  6574	characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set
  6575	ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and
  6576	ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To
  6577	do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie
  6578	undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If
  6579	this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods."
  6580	
  6581	"What will you say?"
  6582	
  6583	"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at
  6584	the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr.
  6585	Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at
  6586	221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."
  6587	
  6588	"Very. But will he see it?"
  6589	
  6590	"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor
  6591	man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his
  6592	mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson
  6593	that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must
  6594	have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his
  6595	bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to
  6596	see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to
  6597	it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency
  6598	and have this put in the evening papers."
  6599	
  6600	"In which, sir?"
  6601	
  6602	"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News,
  6603	Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you."
  6604	
  6605	"Very well, sir. And this stone?"
  6606	
  6607	"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,
  6608	Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here
  6609	with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place
  6610	of the one which your family is now devouring."
  6611	
  6612	When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and
  6613	held it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just
  6614	see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and
  6615	focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet
  6616	baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a
  6617	bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found
  6618	in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable
  6619	in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is
  6620	blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has
  6621	already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a
  6622	vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about
  6623	for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.
  6624	Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the
  6625	gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and
  6626	drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."
  6627	
  6628	"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?"
  6629	
  6630	"I cannot tell."
  6631	
  6632	"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had
  6633	anything to do with the matter?"
  6634	
  6635	"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an
  6636	absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he
  6637	was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made
  6638	of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple
  6639	test if we have an answer to our advertisement."
  6640	
  6641	"And you can do nothing until then?"
  6642	
  6643	"Nothing."
  6644	
  6645	"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall
  6646	come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I
  6647	should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."
  6648	
  6649	"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I
  6650	believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I
  6651	ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."
  6652	
  6653	I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past
  6654	six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I
  6655	approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a
  6656	coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the
  6657	bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I
  6658	arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to
  6659	Holmes' room.
  6660	
  6661	"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair
  6662	and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he
  6663	could so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.
  6664	Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is
  6665	more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have
  6666	just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"
  6667	
  6668	"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."
  6669	
  6670	He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a
  6671	broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of
  6672	grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight
  6673	tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his
  6674	habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in
  6675	front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded
  6676	from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a
  6677	slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the
  6678	impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had
  6679	ill-usage at the hands of fortune.
  6680	
  6681	"We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes,
  6682	"because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your
  6683	address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."
  6684	
  6685	Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not
  6686	been so plentiful with me as they once were," he remarked. "I had
  6687	no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off
  6688	both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a
  6689	hopeless attempt at recovering them."
  6690	
  6691	"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to
  6692	eat it."
  6693	
  6694	"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his
  6695	excitement.
  6696	
  6697	"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.
  6698	But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is
  6699	about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your
  6700	purpose equally well?"
  6701	
  6702	"Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of
  6703	relief.
  6704	
  6705	"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of
  6706	your own bird, so if you wish--"
  6707	
  6708	The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as
  6709	relics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that I can hardly
  6710	see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are
  6711	going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I
  6712	will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive
  6713	upon the sideboard."
  6714	
  6715	Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug
  6716	of his shoulders.
  6717	
  6718	"There is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the
  6719	way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one
  6720	from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a
  6721	better grown goose."
  6722	
  6723	"Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly
  6724	gained property under his arm. "There are a few of us who
  6725	frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in
  6726	the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our
  6727	good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which,
  6728	on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to
  6729	receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the
  6730	rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a
  6731	Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With
  6732	a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
  6733	strode off upon his way.
  6734	
  6735	"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the
  6736	door behind him. "It is quite certain that he knows nothing
  6737	whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"
  6738	
  6739	"Not particularly."
  6740	
  6741	"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow
  6742	up this clue while it is still hot."
  6743	
  6744	"By all means."
  6745	
  6746	It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped
  6747	cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly
  6748	in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out
  6749	into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out
  6750	crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter,
  6751	Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into
  6752	Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at
  6753	the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one
  6754	of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open
  6755	the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from
  6756	the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.
  6757	
  6758	"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,"
  6759	said he.
  6760	
  6761	"My geese!" The man seemed surprised.
  6762	
  6763	"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker,
  6764	who was a member of your goose club."
  6765	
  6766	"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."
  6767	
  6768	"Indeed! Whose, then?"
  6769	
  6770	"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden."
  6771	
  6772	"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?"
  6773	
  6774	"Breckinridge is his name."
  6775	
  6776	"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord,
  6777	and prosperity to your house. Good-night."
  6778	
  6779	"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat
  6780	as we came out into the frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though
  6781	we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we
  6782	have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal
  6783	servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible
  6784	that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we
  6785	have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police,
  6786	and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us
  6787	follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and
  6788	quick march!"
  6789	
  6790	We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a
  6791	zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest
  6792	stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor
  6793	a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was
  6794	helping a boy to put up the shutters.
  6795	
  6796	"Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.
  6797	
  6798	The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my
  6799	companion.
  6800	
  6801	"Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the
  6802	bare slabs of marble.
  6803	
  6804	"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning."
  6805	
  6806	"That's no good."
  6807	
  6808	"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare."
  6809	
  6810	"Ah, but I was recommended to you."
  6811	
  6812	"Who by?"
  6813	
  6814	"The landlord of the Alpha."
  6815	
  6816	"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen."
  6817	
  6818	"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?"
  6819	
  6820	To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the
  6821	salesman.
  6822	
  6823	"Now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms
  6824	akimbo, "what are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now."
  6825	
  6826	"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the
  6827	geese which you supplied to the Alpha."
  6828	
  6829	"Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"
  6830	
  6831	"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you
  6832	should be so warm over such a trifle."
  6833	
  6834	"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.
  6835	When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end
  6836	of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you
  6837	sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One
  6838	would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the
  6839	fuss that is made over them."
  6840	
  6841	"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been
  6842	making inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us
  6843	the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my
  6844	opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the
  6845	bird I ate is country bred."
  6846	
  6847	"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped
  6848	the salesman.
  6849	
  6850	"It's nothing of the kind."
  6851	
  6852	"I say it is."
  6853	
  6854	"I don't believe it."
  6855	
  6856	"D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled
  6857	them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that
  6858	went to the Alpha were town bred."
  6859	
  6860	"You'll never persuade me to believe that."
  6861	
  6862	"Will you bet, then?"
  6863	
  6864	"It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But
  6865	I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be
  6866	obstinate."
  6867	
  6868	The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said
  6869	he.
  6870	
  6871	The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
  6872	greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging
  6873	lamp.
  6874	
  6875	"Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman, "I thought that I
  6876	was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is
  6877	still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"
  6878	
  6879	"Well?"
  6880	
  6881	"That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well,
  6882	then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers
  6883	after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.
  6884	Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a
  6885	list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just
  6886	read it out to me."
  6887	
  6888	"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.
  6889	
  6890	"Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."
  6891	
  6892	Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs.
  6893	Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.'"
  6894	
  6895	"Now, then, what's the last entry?"
  6896	
  6897	"'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.'"
  6898	
  6899	"Quite so. There you are. And underneath?"
  6900	
  6901	"'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.'"
  6902	
  6903	"What have you to say now?"
  6904	
  6905	Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from
  6906	his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the
  6907	air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off
  6908	he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless
  6909	fashion which was peculiar to him.
  6910	
  6911	"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un'
  6912	protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,"
  6913	said he. "I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of
  6914	him, that man would not have given me such complete information
  6915	as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a
  6916	wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our
  6917	quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is
  6918	whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or
  6919	whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what
  6920	that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves
  6921	who are anxious about the matter, and I should--"
  6922	
  6923	His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke
  6924	out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a
  6925	little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of
  6926	yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while
  6927	Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was
  6928	shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.
  6929	
  6930	"I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you
  6931	were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more
  6932	with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs.
  6933	Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with
  6934	it? Did I buy the geese off you?"
  6935	
  6936	"No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little
  6937	man.
  6938	
  6939	"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."
  6940	
  6941	"She told me to ask you."
  6942	
  6943	"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had
  6944	enough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forward, and
  6945	the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.
  6946	
  6947	"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes.
  6948	"Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this
  6949	fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who
  6950	lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook
  6951	the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang
  6952	round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of
  6953	colour had been driven from his face.
  6954	
  6955	"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering
  6956	voice.
  6957	
  6958	"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help
  6959	overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.
  6960	I think that I could be of assistance to you."
  6961	
  6962	"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?"
  6963	
  6964	"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other
  6965	people don't know."
  6966	
  6967	"But you can know nothing of this?"
  6968	
  6969	"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to
  6970	trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton
  6971	Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr.
  6972	Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr.
  6973	Henry Baker is a member."
  6974	
  6975	"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried
  6976	the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.
  6977	"I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter."
  6978	
  6979	Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that
  6980	case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this
  6981	wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we
  6982	go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."
  6983	
  6984	The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he
  6985	answered with a sidelong glance.
  6986	
  6987	"No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always
  6988	awkward doing business with an alias."
  6989	
  6990	A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then,"
  6991	said he, "my real name is James Ryder."
  6992	
  6993	"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray
  6994	step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you
  6995	everything which you would wish to know."
  6996	
  6997	The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
  6998	half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure
  6999	whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.
  7000	Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in
  7001	the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during
  7002	our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and
  7003	the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous
  7004	tension within him.
  7005	
  7006	"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.
  7007	"The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold,
  7008	Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my
  7009	slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then!
  7010	You want to know what became of those geese?"
  7011	
  7012	"Yes, sir."
  7013	
  7014	"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in
  7015	which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the
  7016	tail."
  7017	
  7018	Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell
  7019	me where it went to?"
  7020	
  7021	"It came here."
  7022	
  7023	"Here?"
  7024	
  7025	"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that
  7026	you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was
  7027	dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.
  7028	I have it here in my museum."
  7029	
  7030	Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece
  7031	with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up
  7032	the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold,
  7033	brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a
  7034	drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.
  7035	
  7036	"The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or
  7037	you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,
  7038	Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with
  7039	impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little
  7040	more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"
  7041	
  7042	For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy
  7043	brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring
  7044	with frightened eyes at his accuser.
  7045	
  7046	"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I
  7047	could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.
  7048	Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case
  7049	complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the
  7050	Countess of Morcar's?"
  7051	
  7052	"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a
  7053	crackling voice.
  7054	
  7055	"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of
  7056	sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has
  7057	been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous
  7058	in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the
  7059	making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man
  7060	Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter
  7061	before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.
  7062	What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's
  7063	room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he
  7064	should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled
  7065	the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man
  7066	arrested. You then--"
  7067	
  7068	Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
  7069	companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked.
  7070	"Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I
  7071	never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll
  7072	swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's
  7073	sake, don't!"
  7074	
  7075	"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well
  7076	to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this
  7077	poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."
  7078	
  7079	"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the
  7080	charge against him will break down."
  7081	
  7082	"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account
  7083	of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came
  7084	the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies
  7085	your only hope of safety."
  7086	
  7087	Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you
  7088	it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been
  7089	arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get
  7090	away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment
  7091	the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my
  7092	room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe.
  7093	I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's
  7094	house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton
  7095	Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there
  7096	every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective;
  7097	and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down
  7098	my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me
  7099	what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I
  7100	had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went
  7101	into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would
  7102	be best to do.
  7103	
  7104	"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and
  7105	has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met
  7106	me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they
  7107	could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to
  7108	me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind
  7109	to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my
  7110	confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money.
  7111	But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had
  7112	gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be
  7113	seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat
  7114	pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at
  7115	the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly
  7116	an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the
  7117	best detective that ever lived.
  7118	
  7119	"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the
  7120	pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she
  7121	was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in
  7122	it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in
  7123	the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big
  7124	one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill
  7125	open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger
  7126	could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass
  7127	along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped
  7128	and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the
  7129	matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and
  7130	fluttered off among the others.
  7131	
  7132	"'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.
  7133	
  7134	"'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I
  7135	was feeling which was the fattest.'
  7136	
  7137	"'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we
  7138	call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six
  7139	of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen
  7140	for the market.'
  7141	
  7142	"'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you,
  7143	I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'
  7144	
  7145	"'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we
  7146	fattened it expressly for you.'
  7147	
  7148	"'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.
  7149	
  7150	"'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it
  7151	you want, then?'
  7152	
  7153	"'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the
  7154	flock.'
  7155	
  7156	"'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'
  7157	
  7158	"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird
  7159	all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was
  7160	a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed
  7161	until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My
  7162	heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I
  7163	knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,
  7164	rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There
  7165	was not a bird to be seen there.
  7166	
  7167	"'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.
  7168	
  7169	"'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'
  7170	
  7171	"'Which dealer's?'
  7172	
  7173	"'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'
  7174	
  7175	"'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same
  7176	as the one I chose?'
  7177	
  7178	"'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never
  7179	tell them apart.'
  7180	
  7181	"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my
  7182	feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the
  7183	lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they
  7184	had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always
  7185	answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.
  7186	Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself
  7187	a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which
  7188	I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He burst into
  7189	convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.
  7190	
  7191	There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and
  7192	by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the
  7193	edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.
  7194	
  7195	"Get out!" said he.
  7196	
  7197	"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"
  7198	
  7199	"No more words. Get out!"
  7200	
  7201	And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon
  7202	the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running
  7203	footfalls from the street.
  7204	
  7205	"After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his
  7206	clay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their
  7207	deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing;
  7208	but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must
  7209	collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just
  7210	possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong
  7211	again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and
  7212	you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of
  7213	forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and
  7214	whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you
  7215	will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin
  7216	another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief
  7217	feature."
  7218	
  7219	
  7220	
  7221	VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
  7222	
  7223	On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I
  7224	have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend
  7225	Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number
  7226	merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did
  7227	rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of
  7228	wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation
  7229	which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.
  7230	Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which
  7231	presented more singular features than that which was associated
  7232	with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.
  7233	The events in question occurred in the early days of my
  7234	association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors
  7235	in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them
  7236	upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the
  7237	time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by
  7238	the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It
  7239	is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I
  7240	have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the
  7241	death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even
  7242	more terrible than the truth.
  7243	
  7244	It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to
  7245	find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my
  7246	bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the
  7247	mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I
  7248	blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little
  7249	resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.
  7250	
  7251	"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the
  7252	common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she
  7253	retorted upon me, and I on you."
  7254	
  7255	"What is it, then--a fire?"
  7256	
  7257	"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a
  7258	considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She
  7259	is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander
  7260	about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock
  7261	sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is
  7262	something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it
  7263	prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to
  7264	follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should
  7265	call you and give you the chance."
  7266	
  7267	"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."
  7268	
  7269	I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his
  7270	professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid
  7271	deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a
  7272	logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were
  7273	submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in
  7274	a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A
  7275	lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in
  7276	the window, rose as we entered.
  7277	
  7278	"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is Sherlock
  7279	Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson,
  7280	before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am
  7281	glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the
  7282	fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot
  7283	coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."
  7284	
  7285	"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low
  7286	voice, changing her seat as requested.
  7287	
  7288	"What, then?"
  7289	
  7290	"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as
  7291	she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable
  7292	state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless
  7293	frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features
  7294	and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot
  7295	with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.
  7296	Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,
  7297	all-comprehensive glances.
  7298	
  7299	"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and
  7300	patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no
  7301	doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."
  7302	
  7303	"You know me, then?"
  7304	
  7305	"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm
  7306	of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had
  7307	a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached
  7308	the station."
  7309	
  7310	The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my
  7311	companion.
  7312	
  7313	"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left
  7314	arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven
  7315	places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a
  7316	dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you
  7317	sit on the left-hand side of the driver."
  7318	
  7319	"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said
  7320	she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at
  7321	twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I
  7322	can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.
  7323	I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me,
  7324	and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you,
  7325	Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you
  7326	helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had
  7327	your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me,
  7328	too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness
  7329	which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward
  7330	you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be
  7331	married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you
  7332	shall not find me ungrateful."
  7333	
  7334	Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small
  7335	case-book, which he consulted.
  7336	
  7337	"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was
  7338	concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,
  7339	Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote
  7340	the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to
  7341	reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty
  7342	to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which
  7343	suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us
  7344	everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the
  7345	matter."
  7346	
  7347	"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation
  7348	lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions
  7349	depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to
  7350	another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to
  7351	look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it
  7352	as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can
  7353	read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have
  7354	heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold
  7355	wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid
  7356	the dangers which encompass me."
  7357	
  7358	"I am all attention, madam."
  7359	
  7360	"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who
  7361	is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in
  7362	England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of
  7363	Surrey."
  7364	
  7365	Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.
  7366	
  7367	"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the
  7368	estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north,
  7369	and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four
  7370	successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition,
  7371	and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the
  7372	days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground,
  7373	and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under
  7374	a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence
  7375	there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but
  7376	his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to
  7377	the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which
  7378	enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta,
  7379	where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he
  7380	established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused
  7381	by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he
  7382	beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital
  7383	sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and
  7384	afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.
  7385	
  7386	"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner,
  7387	the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery.
  7388	My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old
  7389	at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable
  7390	sum of money--not less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she
  7391	bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him,
  7392	with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to
  7393	each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return
  7394	to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a
  7395	railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his
  7396	attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us
  7397	to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The
  7398	money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and
  7399	there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.
  7400	
  7401	"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.
  7402	Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our
  7403	neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of
  7404	Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in
  7405	his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious
  7406	quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper
  7407	approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the
  7408	family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been
  7409	intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of
  7410	disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the
  7411	police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village,
  7412	and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of
  7413	immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
  7414	
  7415	"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a
  7416	stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I
  7417	could gather together that I was able to avert another public
  7418	exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies,
  7419	and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few
  7420	acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate,
  7421	and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents,
  7422	wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a
  7423	passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a
  7424	correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon,
  7425	which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the
  7426	villagers almost as much as their master.
  7427	
  7428	"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I
  7429	had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with
  7430	us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was
  7431	but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already
  7432	begun to whiten, even as mine has."
  7433	
  7434	"Your sister is dead, then?"
  7435	
  7436	"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish
  7437	to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I
  7438	have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own
  7439	age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden
  7440	sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we
  7441	were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's
  7442	house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there
  7443	a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My
  7444	stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and
  7445	offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of
  7446	the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event
  7447	occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."
  7448	
  7449	Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes
  7450	closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his
  7451	lids now and glanced across at his visitor.
  7452	
  7453	"Pray be precise as to details," said he.
  7454	
  7455	"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful
  7456	time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have
  7457	already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The
  7458	bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms
  7459	being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms
  7460	the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third
  7461	my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open
  7462	out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"
  7463	
  7464	"Perfectly so."
  7465	
  7466	"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That
  7467	fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we
  7468	knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled
  7469	by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom
  7470	to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where
  7471	she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At
  7472	eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door
  7473	and looked back.
  7474	
  7475	"'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle
  7476	in the dead of the night?'
  7477	
  7478	"'Never,' said I.
  7479	
  7480	"'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in
  7481	your sleep?'
  7482	
  7483	"'Certainly not. But why?'
  7484	
  7485	"'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three
  7486	in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper,
  7487	and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps
  7488	from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would
  7489	just ask you whether you had heard it.'
  7490	
  7491	"'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the
  7492	plantation.'
  7493	
  7494	"'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you
  7495	did not hear it also.'
  7496	
  7497	"'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'
  7498	
  7499	"'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled
  7500	back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her
  7501	key turn in the lock."
  7502	
  7503	"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock
  7504	yourselves in at night?"
  7505	
  7506	"Always."
  7507	
  7508	"And why?"
  7509	
  7510	"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah
  7511	and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were
  7512	locked."
  7513	
  7514	"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."
  7515	
  7516	"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending
  7517	misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect,
  7518	were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two
  7519	souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind
  7520	was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing
  7521	against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale,
  7522	there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew
  7523	that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a
  7524	shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door
  7525	I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and
  7526	a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had
  7527	fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked,
  7528	and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it
  7529	horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By
  7530	the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the
  7531	opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for
  7532	help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a
  7533	drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that
  7534	moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.
  7535	She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were
  7536	dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not
  7537	recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out
  7538	in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was
  7539	the band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she
  7540	would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the
  7541	air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion
  7542	seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for
  7543	my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his
  7544	dressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was
  7545	unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent
  7546	for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for
  7547	she slowly sank and died without having recovered her
  7548	consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."
  7549	
  7550	"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and
  7551	metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"
  7552	
  7553	"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is
  7554	my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of
  7555	the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have
  7556	been deceived."
  7557	
  7558	"Was your sister dressed?"
  7559	
  7560	"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the
  7561	charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."
  7562	
  7563	"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when
  7564	the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did
  7565	the coroner come to?"
  7566	
  7567	"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's
  7568	conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable
  7569	to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that
  7570	the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows
  7571	were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars,
  7572	which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded,
  7573	and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was
  7574	also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is
  7575	wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain,
  7576	therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.
  7577	Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."
  7578	
  7579	"How about poison?"
  7580	
  7581	"The doctors examined her for it, but without success."
  7582	
  7583	"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"
  7584	
  7585	"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock,
  7586	though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."
  7587	
  7588	"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"
  7589	
  7590	"Yes, there are nearly always some there."
  7591	
  7592	"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a
  7593	speckled band?"
  7594	
  7595	"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of
  7596	delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of
  7597	people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not
  7598	know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear
  7599	over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which
  7600	she used."
  7601	
  7602	Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.
  7603	
  7604	"These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your
  7605	narrative."
  7606	
  7607	"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until
  7608	lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend,
  7609	whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask
  7610	my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the
  7611	second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My
  7612	stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to
  7613	be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs
  7614	were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom
  7615	wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the
  7616	chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in
  7617	which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last
  7618	night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I
  7619	suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which
  7620	had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the
  7621	lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to
  7622	go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was
  7623	daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which
  7624	is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on
  7625	this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your
  7626	advice."
  7627	
  7628	"You have done wisely," said my friend. "But have you told me
  7629	all?"
  7630	
  7631	"Yes, all."
  7632	
  7633	"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather."
  7634	
  7635	"Why, what do you mean?"
  7636	
  7637	For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which
  7638	fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little
  7639	livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed
  7640	upon the white wrist.
  7641	
  7642	"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.
  7643	
  7644	The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He
  7645	is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own
  7646	strength."
  7647	
  7648	There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin
  7649	upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.
  7650	
  7651	"This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a
  7652	thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide
  7653	upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If
  7654	we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for
  7655	us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your
  7656	stepfather?"
  7657	
  7658	"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some
  7659	most important business. It is probable that he will be away all
  7660	day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a
  7661	housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily
  7662	get her out of the way."
  7663	
  7664	"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"
  7665	
  7666	"By no means."
  7667	
  7668	"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"
  7669	
  7670	"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am
  7671	in town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to
  7672	be there in time for your coming."
  7673	
  7674	"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some
  7675	small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and
  7676	breakfast?"
  7677	
  7678	"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have
  7679	confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you
  7680	again this afternoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her
  7681	face and glided from the room.
  7682	
  7683	"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes,
  7684	leaning back in his chair.
  7685	
  7686	"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."
  7687	
  7688	"Dark enough and sinister enough."
  7689	
  7690	"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls
  7691	are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,
  7692	then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her
  7693	mysterious end."
  7694	
  7695	"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the
  7696	very peculiar words of the dying woman?"
  7697	
  7698	"I cannot think."
  7699	
  7700	"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of
  7701	a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor,
  7702	the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has
  7703	an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying
  7704	allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner
  7705	heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of
  7706	those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its
  7707	place, I think that there is good ground to think that the
  7708	mystery may be cleared along those lines."
  7709	
  7710	"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"
  7711	
  7712	"I cannot imagine."
  7713	
  7714	"I see many objections to any such theory."
  7715	
  7716	"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going
  7717	to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are
  7718	fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of
  7719	the devil!"
  7720	
  7721	The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that
  7722	our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had
  7723	framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar
  7724	mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a
  7725	black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters,
  7726	with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his
  7727	hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his
  7728	breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,
  7729	seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and
  7730	marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other
  7731	of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,
  7732	fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old
  7733	bird of prey.
  7734	
  7735	"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.
  7736	
  7737	"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my
  7738	companion quietly.
  7739	
  7740	"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."
  7741	
  7742	"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."
  7743	
  7744	"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I
  7745	have traced her. What has she been saying to you?"
  7746	
  7747	"It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.
  7748	
  7749	"What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man
  7750	furiously.
  7751	
  7752	"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my
  7753	companion imperturbably.
  7754	
  7755	"Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step
  7756	forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel!
  7757	I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler."
  7758	
  7759	My friend smiled.
  7760	
  7761	"Holmes, the busybody!"
  7762	
  7763	His smile broadened.
  7764	
  7765	"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"
  7766	
  7767	Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most
  7768	entertaining," said he. "When you go out close the door, for
  7769	there is a decided draught."
  7770	
  7771	"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with
  7772	my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her!
  7773	I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped
  7774	swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with
  7775	his huge brown hands.
  7776	
  7777	"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and
  7778	hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the
  7779	room.
  7780	
  7781	"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am
  7782	not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him
  7783	that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke
  7784	he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort,
  7785	straightened it out again.
  7786	
  7787	"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official
  7788	detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,
  7789	however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer
  7790	from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now,
  7791	Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk
  7792	down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may
  7793	help us in this matter."
  7794	
  7795	
  7796	It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his
  7797	excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled
  7798	over with notes and figures.
  7799	
  7800	"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To
  7801	determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the
  7802	present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The
  7803	total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little
  7804	short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural
  7805	prices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an
  7806	income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident,
  7807	therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have
  7808	had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to
  7809	a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted,
  7810	since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for
  7811	standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson,
  7812	this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is
  7813	aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you
  7814	are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be
  7815	very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your
  7816	pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen
  7817	who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush
  7818	are, I think, all that we need."
  7819	
  7820	At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for
  7821	Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove
  7822	for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a
  7823	perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the
  7824	heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out
  7825	their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant
  7826	smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange
  7827	contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this
  7828	sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in
  7829	the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over
  7830	his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the
  7831	deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the
  7832	shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.
  7833	
  7834	"Look there!" said he.
  7835	
  7836	A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope,
  7837	thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the
  7838	branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a
  7839	very old mansion.
  7840	
  7841	"Stoke Moran?" said he.
  7842	
  7843	"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked
  7844	the driver.
  7845	
  7846	"There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is
  7847	where we are going."
  7848	
  7849	"There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of
  7850	roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the
  7851	house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by
  7852	the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is
  7853	walking."
  7854	
  7855	"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading
  7856	his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."
  7857	
  7858	We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way
  7859	to Leatherhead.
  7860	
  7861	"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile,
  7862	"that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or
  7863	on some definite business. It may stop his gossip.
  7864	Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as
  7865	our word."
  7866	
  7867	Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a
  7868	face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for
  7869	you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned
  7870	out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely
  7871	that he will be back before evening."
  7872	
  7873	"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance,"
  7874	said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had
  7875	occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.
  7876	
  7877	"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."
  7878	
  7879	"So it appears."
  7880	
  7881	"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What
  7882	will he say when he returns?"
  7883	
  7884	"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone
  7885	more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself
  7886	up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to
  7887	your aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our
  7888	time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to
  7889	examine."
  7890	
  7891	The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high
  7892	central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab,
  7893	thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were
  7894	broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly
  7895	caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little
  7896	better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern,
  7897	and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up
  7898	from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.
  7899	Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the
  7900	stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any
  7901	workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and
  7902	down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the
  7903	outsides of the windows.
  7904	
  7905	"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep,
  7906	the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main
  7907	building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"
  7908	
  7909	"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."
  7910	
  7911	"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does
  7912	not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end
  7913	wall."
  7914	
  7915	"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from
  7916	my room."
  7917	
  7918	"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow
  7919	wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There
  7920	are windows in it, of course?"
  7921	
  7922	"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass
  7923	through."
  7924	
  7925	"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were
  7926	unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness
  7927	to go into your room and bar your shutters?"
  7928	
  7929	Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination
  7930	through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the
  7931	shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through
  7932	which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his
  7933	lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built
  7934	firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his
  7935	chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some
  7936	difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were
  7937	bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon
  7938	the matter."
  7939	
  7940	A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which
  7941	the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third
  7942	chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss
  7943	Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her
  7944	fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a
  7945	gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A
  7946	brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow
  7947	white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the
  7948	left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small
  7949	wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save
  7950	for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and
  7951	the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old
  7952	and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building
  7953	of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat
  7954	silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down,
  7955	taking in every detail of the apartment.
  7956	
  7957	"Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last
  7958	pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the
  7959	tassel actually lying upon the pillow.
  7960	
  7961	"It goes to the housekeeper's room."
  7962	
  7963	"It looks newer than the other things?"
  7964	
  7965	"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."
  7966	
  7967	"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"
  7968	
  7969	"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we
  7970	wanted for ourselves."
  7971	
  7972	"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.
  7973	You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to
  7974	this floor." He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in
  7975	his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining
  7976	minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with
  7977	the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he
  7978	walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and
  7979	in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the
  7980	bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.
  7981	
  7982	"Why, it's a dummy," said he.
  7983	
  7984	"Won't it ring?"
  7985	
  7986	"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting.
  7987	You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where
  7988	the little opening for the ventilator is."
  7989	
  7990	"How very absurd! I never noticed that before."
  7991	
  7992	"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are
  7993	one or two very singular points about this room. For example,
  7994	what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another
  7995	room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated
  7996	with the outside air!"
  7997	
  7998	"That is also quite modern," said the lady.
  7999	
  8000	"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.
  8001	
  8002	"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that
  8003	time."
  8004	
  8005	"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy
  8006	bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your
  8007	permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into
  8008	the inner apartment."
  8009	
  8010	Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his
  8011	step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small
  8012	wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an
  8013	armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a
  8014	round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things
  8015	which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each
  8016	and all of them with the keenest interest.
  8017	
  8018	"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.
  8019	
  8020	"My stepfather's business papers."
  8021	
  8022	"Oh! you have seen inside, then?"
  8023	
  8024	"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of
  8025	papers."
  8026	
  8027	"There isn't a cat in it, for example?"
  8028	
  8029	"No. What a strange idea!"
  8030	
  8031	"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which
  8032	stood on the top of it.
  8033	
  8034	"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."
  8035	
  8036	"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a
  8037	saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I
  8038	daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." He
  8039	squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat
  8040	of it with the greatest attention.
  8041	
  8042	"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting
  8043	his lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something interesting!"
  8044	
  8045	The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on
  8046	one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself
  8047	and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.
  8048	
  8049	"What do you make of that, Watson?"
  8050	
  8051	"It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be
  8052	tied."
  8053	
  8054	"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world,
  8055	and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst
  8056	of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and
  8057	with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."
  8058	
  8059	I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as
  8060	it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We
  8061	had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss
  8062	Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he
  8063	roused himself from his reverie.
  8064	
  8065	"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should
  8066	absolutely follow my advice in every respect."
  8067	
  8068	"I shall most certainly do so."
  8069	
  8070	"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may
  8071	depend upon your compliance."
  8072	
  8073	"I assure you that I am in your hands."
  8074	
  8075	"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in
  8076	your room."
  8077	
  8078	Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.
  8079	
  8080	"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the
  8081	village inn over there?"
  8082	
  8083	"Yes, that is the Crown."
  8084	
  8085	"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?"
  8086	
  8087	"Certainly."
  8088	
  8089	"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a
  8090	headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him
  8091	retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window,
  8092	undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then
  8093	withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want
  8094	into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in
  8095	spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."
  8096	
  8097	"Oh, yes, easily."
  8098	
  8099	"The rest you will leave in our hands."
  8100	
  8101	"But what will you do?"
  8102	
  8103	"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate
  8104	the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."
  8105	
  8106	"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,"
  8107	said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.
  8108	
  8109	"Perhaps I have."
  8110	
  8111	"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's
  8112	death."
  8113	
  8114	"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."
  8115	
  8116	"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and
  8117	if she died from some sudden fright."
  8118	
  8119	"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more
  8120	tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if
  8121	Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.
  8122	Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you,
  8123	you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers
  8124	that threaten you."
  8125	
  8126	Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and
  8127	sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and
  8128	from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and
  8129	of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw
  8130	Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside
  8131	the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some
  8132	slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard
  8133	the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which
  8134	he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few
  8135	minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as
  8136	the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
  8137	
  8138	"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the
  8139	gathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you
  8140	to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."
  8141	
  8142	"Can I be of assistance?"
  8143	
  8144	"Your presence might be invaluable."
  8145	
  8146	"Then I shall certainly come."
  8147	
  8148	"It is very kind of you."
  8149	
  8150	"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms
  8151	than was visible to me."
  8152	
  8153	"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine
  8154	that you saw all that I did."
  8155	
  8156	"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose
  8157	that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."
  8158	
  8159	"You saw the ventilator, too?"
  8160	
  8161	"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to
  8162	have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a
  8163	rat could hardly pass through."
  8164	
  8165	"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to
  8166	Stoke Moran."
  8167	
  8168	"My dear Holmes!"
  8169	
  8170	"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her
  8171	sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that
  8172	suggested at once that there must be a communication between the
  8173	two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been
  8174	remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."
  8175	
  8176	"But what harm can there be in that?"
  8177	
  8178	"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A
  8179	ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the
  8180	bed dies. Does not that strike you?"
  8181	
  8182	"I cannot as yet see any connection."
  8183	
  8184	"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"
  8185	
  8186	"No."
  8187	
  8188	"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened
  8189	like that before?"
  8190	
  8191	"I cannot say that I have."
  8192	
  8193	"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same
  8194	relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may
  8195	call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."
  8196	
  8197	"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.
  8198	We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible
  8199	crime."
  8200	
  8201	"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong
  8202	he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge.
  8203	Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.
  8204	This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall
  8205	be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough
  8206	before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet
  8207	pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more
  8208	cheerful."
  8209	
  8210	
  8211	About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished,
  8212	and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours
  8213	passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of
  8214	eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.
  8215	
  8216	"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it
  8217	comes from the middle window."
  8218	
  8219	As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,
  8220	explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance,
  8221	and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A
  8222	moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing
  8223	in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us
  8224	through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.
  8225	
  8226	There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for
  8227	unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way
  8228	among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about
  8229	to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel
  8230	bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted
  8231	child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and
  8232	then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.
  8233	
  8234	"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"
  8235	
  8236	Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like
  8237	a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low
  8238	laugh and put his lips to my ear.
  8239	
  8240	"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."
  8241	
  8242	I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There
  8243	was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders
  8244	at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when,
  8245	after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I
  8246	found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed
  8247	the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes
  8248	round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then
  8249	creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered
  8250	into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to
  8251	distinguish the words:
  8252	
  8253	"The least sound would be fatal to our plans."
  8254	
  8255	I nodded to show that I had heard.
  8256	
  8257	"We must sit without light. He would see it through the
  8258	ventilator."
  8259	
  8260	I nodded again.
  8261	
  8262	"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your
  8263	pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of
  8264	the bed, and you in that chair."
  8265	
  8266	I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.
  8267	
  8268	Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon
  8269	the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the
  8270	stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left
  8271	in darkness.
  8272	
  8273	How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a
  8274	sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my
  8275	companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same
  8276	state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut
  8277	off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.
  8278	
  8279	From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at
  8280	our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that
  8281	the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the
  8282	deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of
  8283	an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and
  8284	one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for
  8285	whatever might befall.
  8286	
  8287	Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the
  8288	direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was
  8289	succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.
  8290	Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle
  8291	sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the
  8292	smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears.
  8293	Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle,
  8294	soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping
  8295	continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes
  8296	sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with
  8297	his cane at the bell-pull.
  8298	
  8299	"You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"
  8300	
  8301	But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I
  8302	heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my
  8303	weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which
  8304	my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face
  8305	was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had
  8306	ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when
  8307	suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most
  8308	horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder
  8309	and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled
  8310	in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the
  8311	village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the
  8312	sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I
  8313	stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it
  8314	had died away into the silence from which it rose.
  8315	
  8316	"What can it mean?" I gasped.
  8317	
  8318	"It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps,
  8319	after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will
  8320	enter Dr. Roylott's room."
  8321	
  8322	With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the
  8323	corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply
  8324	from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his
  8325	heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.
  8326	
  8327	It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a
  8328	dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant
  8329	beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.
  8330	Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott
  8331	clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding
  8332	beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.
  8333	Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we
  8334	had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his
  8335	eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the
  8336	ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with
  8337	brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his
  8338	head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.
  8339	
  8340	"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.
  8341	
  8342	I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began
  8343	to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat
  8344	diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
  8345	
  8346	"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in
  8347	India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence
  8348	does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls
  8349	into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this
  8350	creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to
  8351	some place of shelter and let the county police know what has
  8352	happened."
  8353	
  8354	As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap,
  8355	and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from
  8356	its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into
  8357	the iron safe, which he closed upon it.
  8358	
  8359	Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of
  8360	Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a
  8361	narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling
  8362	how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed
  8363	her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow,
  8364	of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the
  8365	conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly
  8366	playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn
  8367	of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back
  8368	next day.
  8369	
  8370	"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which
  8371	shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from
  8372	insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of
  8373	the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to
  8374	explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of
  8375	by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an
  8376	entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly
  8377	reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me
  8378	that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not
  8379	come either from the window or the door. My attention was
  8380	speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this
  8381	ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The
  8382	discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to
  8383	the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was
  8384	there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and
  8385	coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me,
  8386	and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was
  8387	furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I
  8388	was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of
  8389	poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical
  8390	test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless
  8391	man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such
  8392	a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be
  8393	an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could
  8394	distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where
  8395	the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the
  8396	whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning
  8397	light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by
  8398	the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.
  8399	He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he
  8400	thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the
  8401	rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the
  8402	occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but
  8403	sooner or later she must fall a victim.
  8404	
  8405	"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his
  8406	room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in
  8407	the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary
  8408	in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the
  8409	safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to
  8410	finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic
  8411	clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather
  8412	hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.
  8413	Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in
  8414	order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss
  8415	as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the
  8416	light and attacked it."
  8417	
  8418	"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."
  8419	
  8420	"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master
  8421	at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and
  8422	roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person
  8423	it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.
  8424	Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to
  8425	weigh very heavily upon my conscience."
  8426	
  8427	
  8428	
  8429	IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
  8430	
  8431	Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.
  8432	Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy,
  8433	there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his
  8434	notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel
  8435	Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a
  8436	finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was
  8437	so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that
  8438	it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it
  8439	gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of
  8440	reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story
  8441	has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,
  8442	like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when
  8443	set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the
  8444	facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears
  8445	gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads
  8446	on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a
  8447	deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly
  8448	served to weaken the effect.
  8449	
  8450	It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the
  8451	events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned
  8452	to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker
  8453	Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally
  8454	even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come
  8455	and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I
  8456	happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington
  8457	Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of
  8458	these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was
  8459	never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send
  8460	me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.
  8461	
  8462	One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by
  8463	the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come
  8464	from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I
  8465	dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases
  8466	were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my
  8467	old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door
  8468	tightly behind him.
  8469	
  8470	"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his
  8471	shoulder; "he's all right."
  8472	
  8473	"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was
  8474	some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.
  8475	
  8476	"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him
  8477	round myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe
  8478	and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the
  8479	same as you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even
  8480	giving me time to thank him.
  8481	
  8482	I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the
  8483	table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a
  8484	soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of
  8485	his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all
  8486	over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than
  8487	five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but
  8488	he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who
  8489	was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his
  8490	strength of mind to control.
  8491	
  8492	"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I
  8493	have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by
  8494	train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I
  8495	might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me
  8496	here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon
  8497	the side-table."
  8498	
  8499	I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic
  8500	engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name,
  8501	style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have
  8502	kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You
  8503	are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself
  8504	a monotonous occupation."
  8505	
  8506	"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and
  8507	laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note,
  8508	leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical
  8509	instincts rose up against that laugh.
  8510	
  8511	"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured out
  8512	some water from a caraffe.
  8513	
  8514	It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical
  8515	outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis
  8516	is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very
  8517	weary and pale-looking.
  8518	
  8519	"I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.
  8520	
  8521	"Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water,
  8522	and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.
  8523	
  8524	"That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would
  8525	kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb
  8526	used to be."
  8527	
  8528	He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even
  8529	my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four
  8530	protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the
  8531	thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from
  8532	the roots.
  8533	
  8534	"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have
  8535	bled considerably."
  8536	
  8537	"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must
  8538	have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that
  8539	it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very
  8540	tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."
  8541	
  8542	"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."
  8543	
  8544	"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own
  8545	province."
  8546	
  8547	"This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very
  8548	heavy and sharp instrument."
  8549	
  8550	"A thing like a cleaver," said he.
  8551	
  8552	"An accident, I presume?"
  8553	
  8554	"By no means."
  8555	
  8556	"What! a murderous attack?"
  8557	
  8558	"Very murderous indeed."
  8559	
  8560	"You horrify me."
  8561	
  8562	I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered
  8563	it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back
  8564	without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.
  8565	
  8566	"How is that?" I asked when I had finished.
  8567	
  8568	"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.
  8569	I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through."
  8570	
  8571	"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently
  8572	trying to your nerves."
  8573	
  8574	"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police;
  8575	but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing
  8576	evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they
  8577	believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I
  8578	have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and,
  8579	even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so
  8580	vague that it is a question whether justice will be done."
  8581	
  8582	"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem
  8583	which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you
  8584	to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the
  8585	official police."
  8586	
  8587	"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I
  8588	should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of
  8589	course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me
  8590	an introduction to him?"
  8591	
  8592	"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."
  8593	
  8594	"I should be immensely obliged to you."
  8595	
  8596	"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to
  8597	have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?"
  8598	
  8599	"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."
  8600	
  8601	"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an
  8602	instant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my
  8603	wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my
  8604	new acquaintance to Baker Street.
  8605	
  8606	Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his
  8607	sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The
  8608	Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed
  8609	of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day
  8610	before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the
  8611	mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion,
  8612	ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal.
  8613	When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the
  8614	sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of
  8615	brandy and water within his reach.
  8616	
  8617	"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one,
  8618	Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and make yourself
  8619	absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are
  8620	tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."
  8621	
  8622	"Thank you," said my patient. "but I have felt another man since
  8623	the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has
  8624	completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable
  8625	time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar
  8626	experiences."
  8627	
  8628	Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded
  8629	expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat
  8630	opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story
  8631	which our visitor detailed to us.
  8632	
  8633	"You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor,
  8634	residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a
  8635	hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my
  8636	work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &
  8637	Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago,
  8638	having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of
  8639	money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in
  8640	business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria
  8641	Street.
  8642	
  8643	"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in
  8644	business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so.
  8645	During two years I have had three consultations and one small
  8646	job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought
  8647	me. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s. Every day, from
  8648	nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my
  8649	little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to
  8650	believe that I should never have any practice at all.
  8651	
  8652	"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the
  8653	office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who
  8654	wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with
  8655	the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at
  8656	his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle
  8657	size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have
  8658	ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose
  8659	and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over
  8660	his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his
  8661	natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his
  8662	step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly
  8663	dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than
  8664	thirty.
  8665	
  8666	"'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent.
  8667	'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man
  8668	who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet
  8669	and capable of preserving a secret.'
  8670	
  8671	"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
  8672	address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'
  8673	
  8674	"'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just
  8675	at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both
  8676	an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.'
  8677	
  8678	"'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if
  8679	I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional
  8680	qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter
  8681	that you wished to speak to me?'
  8682	
  8683	"'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to
  8684	the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute
  8685	secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and
  8686	of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than
  8687	from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'
  8688	
  8689	"'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely
  8690	depend upon my doing so.'
  8691	
  8692	"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I
  8693	had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.
  8694	
  8695	"'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.
  8696	
  8697	"'Yes, I promise.'
  8698	
  8699	"'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No
  8700	reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?'
  8701	
  8702	"'I have already given you my word.'
  8703	
  8704	"'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning
  8705	across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was
  8706	empty.
  8707	
  8708	"'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clerks are
  8709	sometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk
  8710	in safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to
  8711	stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.
  8712	
  8713	"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun
  8714	to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man.
  8715	Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from
  8716	showing my impatience.
  8717	
  8718	"'I beg that you will state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time
  8719	is of value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the
  8720	words came to my lips.
  8721	
  8722	"'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.
  8723	
  8724	"'Most admirably.'
  8725	
  8726	"'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I
  8727	simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which
  8728	has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon
  8729	set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as
  8730	that?'
  8731	
  8732	"'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'
  8733	
  8734	"'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last
  8735	train.'
  8736	
  8737	"'Where to?'
  8738	
  8739	"'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders
  8740	of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a
  8741	train from Paddington which would bring you there at about
  8742	11:15.'
  8743	
  8744	"'Very good.'
  8745	
  8746	"'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'
  8747	
  8748	"'There is a drive, then?'
  8749	
  8750	"'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good
  8751	seven miles from Eyford Station.'
  8752	
  8753	"'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there
  8754	would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop
  8755	the night.'
  8756	
  8757	"'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'
  8758	
  8759	"'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient
  8760	hour?'
  8761	
  8762	"'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to
  8763	recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a
  8764	young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the
  8765	very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would
  8766	like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do
  8767	so.'
  8768	
  8769	"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they
  8770	would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to
  8771	accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to
  8772	understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to
  8773	do.'
  8774	
  8775	"'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which
  8776	we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I
  8777	have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all
  8778	laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from
  8779	eavesdroppers?'
  8780	
  8781	"'Entirely.'
  8782	
  8783	"'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that
  8784	fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found
  8785	in one or two places in England?'
  8786	
  8787	"'I have heard so.'
  8788	
  8789	"'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small
  8790	place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to
  8791	discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my
  8792	fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a
  8793	comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two
  8794	very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them,
  8795	however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were
  8796	absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was
  8797	quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my
  8798	interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value,
  8799	but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I
  8800	took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they
  8801	suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little
  8802	deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would
  8803	enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been
  8804	doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we
  8805	erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already
  8806	explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the
  8807	subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it
  8808	once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our
  8809	little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts
  8810	came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these
  8811	fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you
  8812	promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are
  8813	going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'
  8814	
  8815	"'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not
  8816	quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press
  8817	in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out
  8818	like gravel from a pit.'
  8819	
  8820	"'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress
  8821	the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing
  8822	what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully
  8823	into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I
  8824	trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at
  8825	Eyford at 11:15.'
  8826	
  8827	"'I shall certainly be there.'
  8828	
  8829	"'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long,
  8830	questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank
  8831	grasp, he hurried from the room.
  8832	
  8833	"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very
  8834	much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission
  8835	which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was
  8836	glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked
  8837	had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that
  8838	this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face
  8839	and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon
  8840	me, and I could not think that his explanation of the
  8841	fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my
  8842	coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell
  8843	anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate
  8844	a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having
  8845	obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.
  8846	
  8847	"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.
  8848	However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I
  8849	reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the
  8850	only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the
  8851	platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed
  8852	out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of
  8853	the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a
  8854	word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door
  8855	of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either
  8856	side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the
  8857	horse could go."
  8858	
  8859	"One horse?" interjected Holmes.
  8860	
  8861	"Yes, only one."
  8862	
  8863	"Did you observe the colour?"
  8864	
  8865	"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the
  8866	carriage. It was a chestnut."
  8867	
  8868	"Tired-looking or fresh?"
  8869	
  8870	"Oh, fresh and glossy."
  8871	
  8872	"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue
  8873	your most interesting statement."
  8874	
  8875	"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel
  8876	Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I
  8877	should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the
  8878	time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat
  8879	at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than
  8880	once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me
  8881	with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good
  8882	in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I
  8883	tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we
  8884	were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out
  8885	nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now
  8886	and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the
  8887	journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the
  8888	conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the
  8889	road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive,
  8890	and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang
  8891	out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch
  8892	which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of
  8893	the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the
  8894	most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that
  8895	I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,
  8896	and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage
  8897	drove away.
  8898	
  8899	"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled
  8900	about looking for matches and muttering under his breath.
  8901	Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a
  8902	long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew
  8903	broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she
  8904	held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.
  8905	I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which
  8906	the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich
  8907	material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as
  8908	though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a
  8909	gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly
  8910	fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered
  8911	something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room
  8912	from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the
  8913	lamp in his hand.
  8914	
  8915	"'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a
  8916	few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a
  8917	quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the
  8918	centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel
  8919	Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the
  8920	door. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and
  8921	vanished into the darkness.
  8922	
  8923	"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my
  8924	ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises
  8925	on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked
  8926	across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of
  8927	the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded
  8928	across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old
  8929	clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise
  8930	everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began
  8931	to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were
  8932	they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And
  8933	where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was
  8934	all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no
  8935	idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns,
  8936	were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded,
  8937	after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness,
  8938	that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room,
  8939	humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling
  8940	that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.
  8941	
  8942	"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the
  8943	utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman
  8944	was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind
  8945	her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and
  8946	beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with
  8947	fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one
  8948	shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few
  8949	whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back,
  8950	like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.
  8951	
  8952	"'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to
  8953	speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no
  8954	good for you to do.'
  8955	
  8956	"'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I
  8957	cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'
  8958	
  8959	"'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass
  8960	through the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled
  8961	and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and
  8962	made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love
  8963	of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too
  8964	late!'
  8965	
  8966	"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to
  8967	engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I
  8968	thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of
  8969	the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to
  8970	go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried
  8971	out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This
  8972	woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout
  8973	bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I
  8974	cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention
  8975	of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties
  8976	when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps
  8977	was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up
  8978	her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and
  8979	as noiselessly as she had come.
  8980	
  8981	"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man
  8982	with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double
  8983	chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.
  8984	
  8985	"'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the
  8986	way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just
  8987	now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'
  8988	
  8989	"'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I
  8990	felt the room to be a little close.'
  8991	
  8992	"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had
  8993	better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I
  8994	will take you up to see the machine.'
  8995	
  8996	"'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'
  8997	
  8998	"'Oh, no, it is in the house.'
  8999	
  9000	"'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'
  9001	
  9002	"'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that.
  9003	All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us
  9004	know what is wrong with it.'
  9005	
  9006	"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the
  9007	fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house,
  9008	with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little
  9009	low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the
  9010	generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no
  9011	signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster
  9012	was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in
  9013	green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an
  9014	air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the
  9015	lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon
  9016	my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent
  9017	man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at
  9018	least a fellow-countryman.
  9019	
  9020	"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which
  9021	he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three
  9022	of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside,
  9023	and the colonel ushered me in.
  9024	
  9025	"'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and
  9026	it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were
  9027	to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the
  9028	end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of
  9029	many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns
  9030	of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and
  9031	multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine
  9032	goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working
  9033	of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will
  9034	have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set
  9035	it right.'
  9036	
  9037	"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very
  9038	thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of
  9039	exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and
  9040	pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by
  9041	the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed
  9042	a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An
  9043	examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was
  9044	round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to
  9045	fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause
  9046	of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who
  9047	followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical
  9048	questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I
  9049	had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the
  9050	machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.
  9051	It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth
  9052	was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose
  9053	that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a
  9054	purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a
  9055	large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a
  9056	crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was
  9057	scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a
  9058	muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the
  9059	colonel looking down at me.
  9060	
  9061	"'What are you doing there?' he asked.
  9062	
  9063	"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as
  9064	that which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,'
  9065	said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to
  9066	your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it
  9067	was used.'
  9068	
  9069	"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of
  9070	my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in
  9071	his grey eyes.
  9072	
  9073	"'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He
  9074	took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key
  9075	in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it
  9076	was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and
  9077	shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'
  9078	
  9079	"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my
  9080	heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish
  9081	of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp
  9082	still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining
  9083	the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming
  9084	down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than
  9085	myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a
  9086	shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and
  9087	dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let
  9088	me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my
  9089	cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with
  9090	my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it
  9091	flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend
  9092	very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my
  9093	face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to
  9094	think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and
  9095	yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black
  9096	shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand
  9097	erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope
  9098	back to my heart.
  9099	
  9100	"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the
  9101	walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw
  9102	a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which
  9103	broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For
  9104	an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door
  9105	which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself
  9106	through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had
  9107	closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few
  9108	moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me
  9109	how narrow had been my escape.
  9110	
  9111	"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and
  9112	I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor,
  9113	while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand,
  9114	while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend
  9115	whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.
  9116	
  9117	"'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a
  9118	moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste
  9119	the so-precious time, but come!'
  9120	
  9121	"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to
  9122	my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding
  9123	stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we
  9124	reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of
  9125	two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which  we
  9126	were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about
  9127	her like one  who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door
  9128	which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon
  9129	was shining brightly.
  9130	
  9131	"'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be
  9132	that you can jump it.'
  9133	
  9134	"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the
  9135	passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark
  9136	rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a
  9137	butcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom,
  9138	flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and
  9139	wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be
  9140	more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I
  9141	hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between
  9142	my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used,
  9143	then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.
  9144	The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at
  9145	the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round
  9146	him and tried to hold him back.
  9147	
  9148	"'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise
  9149	after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be
  9150	silent! Oh, he will be silent!'
  9151	
  9152	"'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from
  9153	her. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me
  9154	pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the
  9155	window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and
  9156	was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was
  9157	conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the
  9158	garden below.
  9159	
  9160	"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and
  9161	rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I
  9162	understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly,
  9163	however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.
  9164	I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and
  9165	then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and
  9166	that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my
  9167	handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my
  9168	ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the
  9169	rose-bushes.
  9170	
  9171	"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been
  9172	a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was
  9173	breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with
  9174	dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded
  9175	thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the
  9176	particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with
  9177	the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But
  9178	to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house
  9179	nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the
  9180	hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a
  9181	long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the
  9182	very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were
  9183	it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed
  9184	during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
  9185	
  9186	"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning
  9187	train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The
  9188	same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I
  9189	arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel
  9190	Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a
  9191	carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was
  9192	there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three
  9193	miles off.
  9194	
  9195	"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined
  9196	to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the
  9197	police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first
  9198	to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to
  9199	bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do
  9200	exactly what you advise."
  9201	
  9202	We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to
  9203	this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down
  9204	from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he
  9205	placed his cuttings.
  9206	
  9207	"Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It
  9208	appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:
  9209	'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged
  9210	twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten
  9211	o'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was
  9212	dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that
  9213	the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy."
  9214	
  9215	"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the
  9216	girl said."
  9217	
  9218	"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
  9219	desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should
  9220	stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out
  9221	pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well,
  9222	every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall
  9223	go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for
  9224	Eyford."
  9225	
  9226	Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train
  9227	together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.
  9228	There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector
  9229	Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.
  9230	Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the
  9231	seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford
  9232	for its centre.
  9233	
  9234	"There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of
  9235	ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere
  9236	near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."
  9237	
  9238	"It was an hour's good drive."
  9239	
  9240	"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you
  9241	were unconscious?"
  9242	
  9243	"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having
  9244	been lifted and conveyed somewhere."
  9245	
  9246	"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have
  9247	spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.
  9248	Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."
  9249	
  9250	"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face
  9251	in my life."
  9252	
  9253	"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I
  9254	have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon
  9255	it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."
  9256	
  9257	"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.
  9258	
  9259	"Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your
  9260	opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is
  9261	south, for the country is more deserted there."
  9262	
  9263	"And I say east," said my patient.
  9264	
  9265	"I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are
  9266	several quiet little villages up there."
  9267	
  9268	"And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there,
  9269	and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up
  9270	any."
  9271	
  9272	"Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty
  9273	diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do
  9274	you give your casting vote to?"
  9275	
  9276	"You are all wrong."
  9277	
  9278	"But we can't all be."
  9279	
  9280	"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the
  9281	centre of the circle. "This is where we shall find them."
  9282	
  9283	"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.
  9284	
  9285	"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the
  9286	horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that
  9287	if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"
  9288	
  9289	"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet
  9290	thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature
  9291	of this gang."
  9292	
  9293	"None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale,
  9294	and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the
  9295	place of silver."
  9296	
  9297	"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,"
  9298	said the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by
  9299	the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could
  9300	get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that
  9301	showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this
  9302	lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."
  9303	
  9304	But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not
  9305	destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into
  9306	Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed
  9307	up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and
  9308	hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.
  9309	
  9310	"A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off
  9311	again on its way.
  9312	
  9313	"Yes, sir!" said the station-master.
  9314	
  9315	"When did it break out?"
  9316	
  9317	"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse,
  9318	and the whole place is in a blaze."
  9319	
  9320	"Whose house is it?"
  9321	
  9322	"Dr. Becher's."
  9323	
  9324	"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very
  9325	thin, with a long, sharp nose?"
  9326	
  9327	The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an
  9328	Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a
  9329	better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him,
  9330	a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as
  9331	if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."
  9332	
  9333	The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all
  9334	hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low
  9335	hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in
  9336	front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in
  9337	the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to
  9338	keep the flames under.
  9339	
  9340	"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is
  9341	the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That
  9342	second window is the one that I jumped from."
  9343	
  9344	"Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon
  9345	them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which,
  9346	when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls,
  9347	though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to
  9348	observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for
  9349	your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are
  9350	a good hundred miles off by now."
  9351	
  9352	And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this
  9353	no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the
  9354	sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a
  9355	peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very
  9356	bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but
  9357	there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes'
  9358	ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their
  9359	whereabouts.
  9360	
  9361	The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
  9362	which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a
  9363	newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.
  9364	About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and
  9365	they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in,
  9366	and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save
  9367	some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of
  9368	the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so
  9369	dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored
  9370	in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have
  9371	explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been
  9372	already referred to.
  9373	
  9374	How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to
  9375	the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained
  9376	forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a
  9377	very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two
  9378	persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other
  9379	unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the
  9380	silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his
  9381	companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out
  9382	of the way of danger.
  9383	
  9384	"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return
  9385	once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I
  9386	have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what
  9387	have I gained?"
  9388	
  9389	"Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of
  9390	value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the
  9391	reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your
  9392	existence."
  9393	
  9394	
  9395	
  9396	X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
  9397	
  9398	The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have
  9399	long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles
  9400	in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have
  9401	eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the
  9402	gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to
  9403	believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to
  9404	the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a
  9405	considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no
  9406	memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of
  9407	this remarkable episode.
  9408	
  9409	It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I
  9410	was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came
  9411	home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table
  9412	waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather
  9413	had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and
  9414	the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as
  9415	a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.
  9416	With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had
  9417	surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last,
  9418	saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and
  9419	lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
  9420	envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's
  9421	noble correspondent could be.
  9422	
  9423	"Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered.
  9424	"Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a
  9425	fish-monger and a tide-waiter."
  9426	
  9427	"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he
  9428	answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the more
  9429	interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social
  9430	summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."
  9431	
  9432	He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.
  9433	
  9434	"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all."
  9435	
  9436	"Not social, then?"
  9437	
  9438	"No, distinctly professional."
  9439	
  9440	"And from a noble client?"
  9441	
  9442	"One of the highest in England."
  9443	
  9444	"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."
  9445	
  9446	"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my
  9447	client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his
  9448	case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be
  9449	wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the
  9450	papers diligently of late, have you not?"
  9451	
  9452	"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in
  9453	the corner. "I have had nothing else to do."
  9454	
  9455	"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I
  9456	read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The
  9457	latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent
  9458	events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his
  9459	wedding?"
  9460	
  9461	"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."
  9462	
  9463	"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord
  9464	St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn
  9465	over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.
  9466	This is what he says:
  9467	
  9468	"'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I
  9469	may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I
  9470	have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you
  9471	in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in
  9472	connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is
  9473	acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no
  9474	objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that
  9475	it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in
  9476	the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that
  9477	time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of
  9478	paramount importance. Yours faithfully, ST. SIMON.'
  9479	
  9480	"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen,
  9481	and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink
  9482	upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes
  9483	as he folded up the epistle.
  9484	
  9485	"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an
  9486	hour."
  9487	
  9488	"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon
  9489	the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in
  9490	their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client
  9491	is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of
  9492	reference beside the mantelpiece. "Here he is," said he, sitting
  9493	down and flattening it out upon his knee. "'Lord Robert Walsingham
  9494	de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms:
  9495	Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.'
  9496	He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was
  9497	Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The
  9498	Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.
  9499	They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on
  9500	the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in
  9501	all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something
  9502	more solid."
  9503	
  9504	"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I,
  9505	"for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as
  9506	remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew
  9507	that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the
  9508	intrusion of other matters."
  9509	
  9510	"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square
  9511	furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it
  9512	was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your
  9513	newspaper selections."
  9514	
  9515	"Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal
  9516	column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks
  9517	back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if
  9518	rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert
  9519	St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty
  9520	Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San
  9521	Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all."
  9522	
  9523	"Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long,
  9524	thin legs towards the fire.
  9525	
  9526	"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society
  9527	papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a
  9528	call for protection in the marriage market, for the present
  9529	free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home
  9530	product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great
  9531	Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across
  9532	the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last
  9533	week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by
  9534	these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself
  9535	for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has
  9536	now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty
  9537	Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss
  9538	Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much
  9539	attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child,
  9540	and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
  9541	considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the
  9542	future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has
  9543	been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years,
  9544	and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small
  9545	estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress
  9546	is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to
  9547	make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a
  9548	British peeress.'"
  9549	
  9550	"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.
  9551	
  9552	"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post
  9553	to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it
  9554	would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen
  9555	intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would
  9556	return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been
  9557	taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on
  9558	Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had
  9559	taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord
  9560	Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices
  9561	which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."
  9562	
  9563	"Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.
  9564	
  9565	"The vanishing of the lady."
  9566	
  9567	"When did she vanish, then?"
  9568	
  9569	"At the wedding breakfast."
  9570	
  9571	"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite
  9572	dramatic, in fact."
  9573	
  9574	"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."
  9575	
  9576	"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during
  9577	the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt
  9578	as this. Pray let me have the details."
  9579	
  9580	"I warn you that they are very incomplete."
  9581	
  9582	"Perhaps we may make them less so."
  9583	
  9584	"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a
  9585	morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is
  9586	headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':
  9587	
  9588	"'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the
  9589	greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which
  9590	have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as
  9591	shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the
  9592	previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to
  9593	confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently
  9594	floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush
  9595	the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it
  9596	that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what
  9597	is a common subject for conversation.
  9598	
  9599	"'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover
  9600	Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the
  9601	father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral,
  9602	Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the
  9603	younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia
  9604	Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of
  9605	Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been
  9606	prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a
  9607	woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to
  9608	force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging
  9609	that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a
  9610	painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler
  9611	and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house
  9612	before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast
  9613	with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and
  9614	retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some
  9615	comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that
  9616	she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an
  9617	ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the
  9618	footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus
  9619	apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress,
  9620	believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his
  9621	daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with
  9622	the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with
  9623	the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which
  9624	will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very
  9625	singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing
  9626	had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There
  9627	are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the
  9628	police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the
  9629	original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some
  9630	other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange
  9631	disappearance of the bride.'"
  9632	
  9633	"And is that all?"
  9634	
  9635	"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is
  9636	a suggestive one."
  9637	
  9638	"And it is--"
  9639	
  9640	"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance,
  9641	has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a
  9642	danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom
  9643	for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole
  9644	case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the
  9645	public press."
  9646	
  9647	"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would
  9648	not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell,
  9649	Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I
  9650	have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not
  9651	dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness,
  9652	if only as a check to my own memory."
  9653	
  9654	"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open
  9655	the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face,
  9656	high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about
  9657	the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose
  9658	pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His
  9659	manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue
  9660	impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little
  9661	bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off
  9662	his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin
  9663	upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of
  9664	foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat,
  9665	yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters.
  9666	He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to
  9667	right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his
  9668	golden eyeglasses.
  9669	
  9670	"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray
  9671	take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.
  9672	Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this
  9673	matter over."
  9674	
  9675	"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine,
  9676	Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you
  9677	have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,
  9678	though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of
  9679	society."
  9680	
  9681	"No, I am descending."
  9682	
  9683	"I beg pardon."
  9684	
  9685	"My last client of the sort was a king."
  9686	
  9687	"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"
  9688	
  9689	"The King of Scandinavia."
  9690	
  9691	"What! Had he lost his wife?"
  9692	
  9693	"You can understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to the
  9694	affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to
  9695	you in yours."
  9696	
  9697	"Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to
  9698	my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may
  9699	assist you in forming an opinion."
  9700	
  9701	"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public
  9702	prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--
  9703	this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride."
  9704	
  9705	Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it
  9706	goes."
  9707	
  9708	"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could
  9709	offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most
  9710	directly by questioning you."
  9711	
  9712	"Pray do so."
  9713	
  9714	"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"
  9715	
  9716	"In San Francisco, a year ago."
  9717	
  9718	"You were travelling in the States?"
  9719	
  9720	"Yes."
  9721	
  9722	"Did you become engaged then?"
  9723	
  9724	"No."
  9725	
  9726	"But you were on a friendly footing?"
  9727	
  9728	"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was
  9729	amused."
  9730	
  9731	"Her father is very rich?"
  9732	
  9733	"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."
  9734	
  9735	"And how did he make his money?"
  9736	
  9737	"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,
  9738	invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."
  9739	
  9740	"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your
  9741	wife's character?"
  9742	
  9743	The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down
  9744	into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was
  9745	twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she
  9746	ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or
  9747	mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than
  9748	from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy,
  9749	with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of
  9750	traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She
  9751	is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
  9752	resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the
  9753	name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately
  9754	cough--"had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I
  9755	believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that
  9756	anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."
  9757	
  9758	"Have you her photograph?"
  9759	
  9760	"I brought this with me." He opened a locket and showed us the
  9761	full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an
  9762	ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect
  9763	of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the
  9764	exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he
  9765	closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.
  9766	
  9767	"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your
  9768	acquaintance?"
  9769	
  9770	"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I
  9771	met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now
  9772	married her."
  9773	
  9774	"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?"
  9775	
  9776	"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family."
  9777	
  9778	"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a
  9779	fait accompli?"
  9780	
  9781	"I really have made no inquiries on the subject."
  9782	
  9783	"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the
  9784	wedding?"
  9785	
  9786	"Yes."
  9787	
  9788	"Was she in good spirits?"
  9789	
  9790	"Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our
  9791	future lives."
  9792	
  9793	"Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the
  9794	wedding?"
  9795	
  9796	"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the
  9797	ceremony."
  9798	
  9799	"And did you observe any change in her then?"
  9800	
  9801	"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had
  9802	ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident
  9803	however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible
  9804	bearing upon the case."
  9805	
  9806	"Pray let us have it, for all that."
  9807	
  9808	"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards
  9809	the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it
  9810	fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the
  9811	gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not
  9812	appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of
  9813	the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our
  9814	way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."
  9815	
  9816	"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of
  9817	the general public were present, then?"
  9818	
  9819	"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is
  9820	open."
  9821	
  9822	"This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"
  9823	
  9824	"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a
  9825	common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But
  9826	really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point."
  9827	
  9828	"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less
  9829	cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do
  9830	on re-entering her father's house?"
  9831	
  9832	"I saw her in conversation with her maid."
  9833	
  9834	"And who is her maid?"
  9835	
  9836	"Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California
  9837	with her."
  9838	
  9839	"A confidential servant?"
  9840	
  9841	"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed
  9842	her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they
  9843	look upon these things in a different way."
  9844	
  9845	"How long did she speak to this Alice?"
  9846	
  9847	"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of."
  9848	
  9849	"You did not overhear what they said?"
  9850	
  9851	"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was
  9852	accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she
  9853	meant."
  9854	
  9855	"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your
  9856	wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"
  9857	
  9858	"She walked into the breakfast-room."
  9859	
  9860	"On your arm?"
  9861	
  9862	"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.
  9863	Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose
  9864	hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She
  9865	never came back."
  9866	
  9867	"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to
  9868	her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a
  9869	bonnet, and went out."
  9870	
  9871	"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in
  9872	company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who
  9873	had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that
  9874	morning."
  9875	
  9876	"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady,
  9877	and your relations to her."
  9878	
  9879	Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.
  9880	"We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on
  9881	a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have
  9882	not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of
  9883	complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes.
  9884	Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and
  9885	devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she
  9886	heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the
  9887	reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I
  9888	feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to
  9889	Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to
  9890	push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my
  9891	wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the
  9892	possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police
  9893	fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.
  9894	She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a
  9895	row."
  9896	
  9897	"Did your wife hear all this?"
  9898	
  9899	"No, thank goodness, she did not."
  9900	
  9901	"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"
  9902	
  9903	"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as
  9904	so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid
  9905	some terrible trap for her."
  9906	
  9907	"Well, it is a possible supposition."
  9908	
  9909	"You think so, too?"
  9910	
  9911	"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon
  9912	this as likely?"
  9913	
  9914	"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."
  9915	
  9916	"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray
  9917	what is your own theory as to what took place?"
  9918	
  9919	"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I
  9920	have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may
  9921	say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of
  9922	this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a
  9923	social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous
  9924	disturbance in my wife."
  9925	
  9926	"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"
  9927	
  9928	"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I
  9929	will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to
  9930	without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."
  9931	
  9932	"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said
  9933	Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have
  9934	nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the
  9935	breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"
  9936	
  9937	"We could see the other side of the road and the Park."
  9938	
  9939	"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.
  9940	I shall communicate with you."
  9941	
  9942	"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our
  9943	client, rising.
  9944	
  9945	"I have solved it."
  9946	
  9947	"Eh? What was that?"
  9948	
  9949	"I say that I have solved it."
  9950	
  9951	"Where, then, is my wife?"
  9952	
  9953	"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."
  9954	
  9955	Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take
  9956	wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a
  9957	stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.
  9958	
  9959	"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting
  9960	it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I
  9961	think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all
  9962	this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the
  9963	case before our client came into the room."
  9964	
  9965	"My dear Holmes!"
  9966	
  9967	"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I
  9968	remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination
  9969	served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial
  9970	evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a
  9971	trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."
  9972	
  9973	"But I have heard all that you have heard."
  9974	
  9975	"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which
  9976	serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some
  9977	years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich
  9978	the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these
  9979	cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!
  9980	You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are
  9981	cigars in the box."
  9982	
  9983	The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat,
  9984	which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a
  9985	black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated
  9986	himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.
  9987	
  9988	"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You
  9989	look dissatisfied."
  9990	
  9991	"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage
  9992	case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."
  9993	
  9994	"Really! You surprise me."
  9995	
  9996	"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip
  9997	through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day."
  9998	
  9999	"And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his
 10000	hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.
 10001	
 10002	"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."
 10003	
 10004	"In heaven's name, what for?"
 10005	
 10006	"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."
 10007	
 10008	Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.
 10009	
 10010	"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he
 10011	asked.
 10012	
 10013	"Why? What do you mean?"
 10014	
 10015	"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in
 10016	the one as in the other."
 10017	
 10018	Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you
 10019	know all about it," he snarled.
 10020	
 10021	"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."
 10022	
 10023	"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in
 10024	the matter?"
 10025	
 10026	"I think it very unlikely."
 10027	
 10028	"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found
 10029	this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the
 10030	floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin
 10031	shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked
 10032	in water. "There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the
 10033	top of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master
 10034	Holmes."
 10035	
 10036	"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.
 10037	"You dragged them from the Serpentine?"
 10038	
 10039	"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.
 10040	They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me
 10041	that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."
 10042	
 10043	"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found
 10044	in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope
 10045	to arrive at through this?"
 10046	
 10047	"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance."
 10048	
 10049	"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."
 10050	
 10051	"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I
 10052	am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your
 10053	deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as
 10054	many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."
 10055	
 10056	"And how?"
 10057	
 10058	"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the
 10059	card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it
 10060	down upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will
 10061	see me when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.' Now my theory all
 10062	along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora
 10063	Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was
 10064	responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her
 10065	initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped
 10066	into her hand at the door and which lured her within their
 10067	reach."
 10068	
 10069	"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are
 10070	very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a
 10071	listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he
 10072	gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important,"
 10073	said he.
 10074	
 10075	"Ha! you find it so?"
 10076	
 10077	"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."
 10078	
 10079	Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he
 10080	shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"
 10081	
 10082	"On the contrary, this is the right side."
 10083	
 10084	"The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil
 10085	over here."
 10086	
 10087	"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel
 10088	bill, which interests me deeply."
 10089	
 10090	"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade.
 10091	"'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s.
 10092	6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."
 10093	
 10094	"Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the
 10095	note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I
 10096	congratulate you again."
 10097	
 10098	"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in
 10099	hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.
 10100	Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom
 10101	of the matter first." He gathered up the garments, thrust them
 10102	into the bag, and made for the door.
 10103	
 10104	"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival
 10105	vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady
 10106	St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any
 10107	such person."
 10108	
 10109	Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me,
 10110	tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and
 10111	hurried away.
 10112	
 10113	He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on
 10114	his overcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says about
 10115	outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must
 10116	leave you to your papers for a little."
 10117	
 10118	It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had
 10119	no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a
 10120	confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked
 10121	with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and
 10122	presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean
 10123	little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble
 10124	lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold
 10125	woodcock, a pheasant, a p?t? de foie gras pie with a group of
 10126	ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries,
 10127	my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian
 10128	Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid
 10129	for and were ordered to this address.
 10130	
 10131	Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the
 10132	room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his
 10133	eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his
 10134	conclusions.
 10135	
 10136	"They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.
 10137	
 10138	"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."
 10139	
 10140	"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I
 10141	am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I
 10142	fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."
 10143	
 10144	It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,
 10145	dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very
 10146	perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.
 10147	
 10148	"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.
 10149	
 10150	"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.
 10151	Have you good authority for what you say?"
 10152	
 10153	"The best possible."
 10154	
 10155	Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his
 10156	forehead.
 10157	
 10158	"What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of
 10159	the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"
 10160	
 10161	"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any
 10162	humiliation."
 10163	
 10164	"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."
 10165	
 10166	"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the
 10167	lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of
 10168	doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she
 10169	had no one to advise her at such a crisis."
 10170	
 10171	"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon,
 10172	tapping his fingers upon the table.
 10173	
 10174	"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so
 10175	unprecedented a position."
 10176	
 10177	"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have
 10178	been shamefully used."
 10179	
 10180	"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps
 10181	on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view
 10182	of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here
 10183	who may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a
 10184	lady and gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to
 10185	introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I
 10186	think, you have already met."
 10187	
 10188	At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his
 10189	seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand
 10190	thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended
 10191	dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out
 10192	her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was
 10193	as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was
 10194	one which it was hard to resist.
 10195	
 10196	"You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have every
 10197	cause to be."
 10198	
 10199	"Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.
 10200	
 10201	"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I
 10202	should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of
 10203	rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just
 10204	didn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't
 10205	fall down and do a faint right there before the altar."
 10206	
 10207	"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave
 10208	the room while you explain this matter?"
 10209	
 10210	"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman,
 10211	"we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business
 10212	already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to
 10213	hear the rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man,
 10214	clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.
 10215	
 10216	"Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Frank here
 10217	and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where pa
 10218	was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I;
 10219	but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile,
 10220	while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to
 10221	nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa
 10222	wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took
 10223	me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so
 10224	he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything
 10225	about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just
 10226	fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and
 10227	make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had
 10228	as much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of
 10229	time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.
 10230	'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and
 10231	then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your
 10232	husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had
 10233	fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting,
 10234	that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek
 10235	his fortune, and I went back to pa.
 10236	
 10237	"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then
 10238	he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New
 10239	Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a
 10240	miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was
 10241	my Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was
 10242	very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took
 10243	me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a
 10244	year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really
 10245	dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London,
 10246	and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt
 10247	all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
 10248	in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.
 10249	
 10250	"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done
 10251	my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our
 10252	actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make
 10253	him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may
 10254	imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I
 10255	glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the
 10256	first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked
 10257	again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as
 10258	if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I
 10259	didn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the
 10260	words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my
 10261	ear. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and make
 10262	a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to
 10263	know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to
 10264	tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper,
 10265	and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on
 10266	the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the
 10267	note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a
 10268	line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.
 10269	Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now
 10270	to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.
 10271	
 10272	"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California,
 10273	and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but
 10274	to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to
 10275	have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before
 10276	his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to
 10277	run away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten
 10278	minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of
 10279	the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park.
 10280	I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman
 10281	came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to
 10282	me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little
 10283	secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away
 10284	from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and
 10285	away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and
 10286	that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank
 10287	had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to
 10288	'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to
 10289	England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the
 10290	very morning of my second wedding."
 10291	
 10292	"I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It gave the name
 10293	and the church but not where the lady lived."
 10294	
 10295	"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all
 10296	for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I
 10297	should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just
 10298	sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It
 10299	was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting
 10300	round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So
 10301	Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of
 10302	them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away
 10303	somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we
 10304	should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good
 10305	gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how
 10306	he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very
 10307	clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and
 10308	that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so
 10309	secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord
 10310	St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at
 10311	once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if
 10312	I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very
 10313	meanly of me."
 10314	
 10315	Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but
 10316	had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this
 10317	long narrative.
 10318	
 10319	"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most
 10320	intimate personal affairs in this public manner."
 10321	
 10322	"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"
 10323	
 10324	"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out
 10325	his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.
 10326	
 10327	"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us
 10328	in a friendly supper."
 10329	
 10330	"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his
 10331	Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent
 10332	developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over
 10333	them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a
 10334	very good-night." He included us all in a sweeping bow and
 10335	stalked out of the room.
 10336	
 10337	"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your
 10338	company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an
 10339	American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the
 10340	folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone
 10341	years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens
 10342	of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a
 10343	quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."
 10344	
 10345	"The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our
 10346	visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how
 10347	simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight
 10348	seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural
 10349	than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing
 10350	stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr.
 10351	Lestrade of Scotland Yard."
 10352	
 10353	"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"
 10354	
 10355	"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that
 10356	the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony,
 10357	the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of
 10358	returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the
 10359	morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that
 10360	something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was
 10361	out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she
 10362	seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America
 10363	because she had spent so short a time in this country that she
 10364	could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence
 10365	over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change
 10366	her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a
 10367	process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an
 10368	American. Then who could this American be, and why should he
 10369	possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might
 10370	be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in
 10371	rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got
 10372	before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us
 10373	of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so
 10374	transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a
 10375	bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very
 10376	significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance
 10377	means taking possession of that which another person has a prior
 10378	claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had
 10379	gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a
 10380	previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."
 10381	
 10382	"And how in the world did you find them?"
 10383	
 10384	"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held
 10385	information in his hands the value of which he did not himself
 10386	know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance,
 10387	but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had
 10388	settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels."
 10389	
 10390	"How did you deduce the select?"
 10391	
 10392	"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence
 10393	for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive
 10394	hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate.
 10395	In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I
 10396	learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an
 10397	American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking
 10398	over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I
 10399	had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded
 10400	to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate
 10401	enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them
 10402	some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
 10403	better in every way that they should make their position a little
 10404	clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in
 10405	particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I
 10406	made him keep the appointment."
 10407	
 10408	"But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was
 10409	certainly not very gracious."
 10410	
 10411	"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be
 10412	very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and
 10413	wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of
 10414	fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully
 10415	and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in
 10416	the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for
 10417	the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away
 10418	these bleak autumnal evenings."
 10419	
 10420	
 10421	
 10422	XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
 10423	
 10424	"Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking
 10425	down the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rather
 10426	sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."
 10427	
 10428	My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands
 10429	in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It
 10430	was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day
 10431	before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the
 10432	wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed
 10433	into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and
 10434	on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as
 10435	when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but
 10436	was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer
 10437	passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the
 10438	Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
 10439	whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.
 10440	
 10441	He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a
 10442	massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was
 10443	dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining
 10444	hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet
 10445	his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress
 10446	and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little
 10447	springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to
 10448	set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and
 10449	down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most
 10450	extraordinary contortions.
 10451	
 10452	"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is
 10453	looking up at the numbers of the houses."
 10454	
 10455	"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his
 10456	hands.
 10457	
 10458	"Here?"
 10459	
 10460	"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I
 10461	think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As
 10462	he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and
 10463	pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the
 10464	clanging.
 10465	
 10466	A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still
 10467	gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in
 10468	his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and
 10469	pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his
 10470	body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the
 10471	extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his
 10472	feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we
 10473	both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room.
 10474	Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting
 10475	beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy,
 10476	soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.
 10477	
 10478	"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he.
 10479	"You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have
 10480	recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into
 10481	any little problem which you may submit to me."
 10482	
 10483	The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting
 10484	against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his
 10485	brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.
 10486	
 10487	"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.
 10488	
 10489	"I see that you have had some great trouble," responded Holmes.
 10490	
 10491	"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my
 10492	reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might
 10493	have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet
 10494	borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man;
 10495	but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have
 10496	been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone.
 10497	The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found
 10498	out of this horrible affair."
 10499	
 10500	"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a
 10501	clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen
 10502	you."
 10503	
 10504	"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your
 10505	ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &
 10506	Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."
 10507	
 10508	The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior
 10509	partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City
 10510	of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the
 10511	foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We
 10512	waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced
 10513	himself to tell his story.
 10514	
 10515	"I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened
 10516	here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure
 10517	your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and
 10518	hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this
 10519	snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who
 10520	takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the
 10521	facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.
 10522	
 10523	"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking
 10524	business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative
 10525	investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection
 10526	and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means
 10527	of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security
 10528	is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction
 10529	during the last few years, and there are many noble families to
 10530	whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their
 10531	pictures, libraries, or plate.
 10532	
 10533	"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a
 10534	card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I
 10535	saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps
 10536	even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name
 10537	which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest,
 10538	noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the
 10539	honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged
 10540	at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry
 10541	quickly through a disagreeable task.
 10542	
 10543	"'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in the
 10544	habit of advancing money.'
 10545	
 10546	"'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.
 10547	
 10548	"'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have
 10549	50,000 pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a
 10550	sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it
 10551	a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my
 10552	position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place
 10553	one's self under obligations.'
 10554	
 10555	"'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.
 10556	
 10557	"'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most
 10558	certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you
 10559	think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the
 10560	money should be paid at once.'
 10561	
 10562	"'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my
 10563	own private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be
 10564	rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do
 10565	it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must
 10566	insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution
 10567	should be taken.'
 10568	
 10569	"'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a
 10570	square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair.
 10571	'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?'
 10572	
 10573	"'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,'
 10574	said I.
 10575	
 10576	"'Precisely.' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,
 10577	flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery
 10578	which he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said
 10579	he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The
 10580	lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the
 10581	sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my
 10582	security.'
 10583	
 10584	"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some
 10585	perplexity from it to my illustrious client.
 10586	
 10587	"'You doubt its value?' he asked.
 10588	
 10589	"'Not at all. I only doubt--'
 10590	
 10591	"'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest
 10592	about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely
 10593	certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a
 10594	pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'
 10595	
 10596	"'Ample.'
 10597	
 10598	"'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof
 10599	of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I
 10600	have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to
 10601	refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to
 10602	preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I
 10603	need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any
 10604	harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as
 10605	serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the
 10606	world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.
 10607	I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall
 10608	call for it in person on Monday morning.'
 10609	
 10610	"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,
 10611	calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000
 10612	pound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the
 10613	precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not
 10614	but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
 10615	which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it
 10616	was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any
 10617	misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever
 10618	consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter
 10619	the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned
 10620	once more to my work.
 10621	
 10622	"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave
 10623	so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had
 10624	been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how
 10625	terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I
 10626	determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always
 10627	carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might
 10628	never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a
 10629	cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel
 10630	with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs
 10631	and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.
 10632	
 10633	"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to
 10634	thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep
 10635	out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three
 10636	maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose
 10637	absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy
 10638	Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few
 10639	months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has
 10640	always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has
 10641	attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.
 10642	That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we
 10643	believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.
 10644	
 10645	"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it
 10646	will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an
 10647	only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr.
 10648	Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am
 10649	myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very
 10650	likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I
 10651	had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a
 10652	moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it
 10653	would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I
 10654	meant it for the best.
 10655	
 10656	"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
 10657	business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild,
 10658	wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the
 10659	handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a
 10660	member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming
 10661	manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long
 10662	purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards
 10663	and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again
 10664	to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
 10665	allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried
 10666	more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he
 10667	was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir
 10668	George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.
 10669	
 10670	"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George
 10671	Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently
 10672	brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could
 10673	hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than
 10674	Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been
 10675	everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of
 10676	great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far
 10677	away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his
 10678	cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that
 10679	he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so,
 10680	too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into
 10681	character.
 10682	
 10683	"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but
 10684	when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the
 10685	world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my
 10686	daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful,
 10687	a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and
 10688	gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know
 10689	what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone
 10690	against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for
 10691	he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I
 10692	think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it
 10693	would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his
 10694	whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!
 10695	
 10696	"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and
 10697	I shall continue with my miserable story.
 10698	
 10699	"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after
 10700	dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious
 10701	treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name
 10702	of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am
 10703	sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.
 10704	Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous
 10705	coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.
 10706	
 10707	"'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.
 10708	
 10709	"'In my own bureau.'
 10710	
 10711	"'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the
 10712	night.' said he.
 10713	
 10714	"'It is locked up,' I answered.
 10715	
 10716	"'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I
 10717	have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'
 10718	
 10719	"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of
 10720	what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with
 10721	a very grave face.
 10722	
 10723	"'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let
 10724	me have 200 pounds?'
 10725	
 10726	"'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too
 10727	generous with you in money matters.'
 10728	
 10729	"'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money,
 10730	or else I can never show my face inside the club again.'
 10731	
 10732	"'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.
 10733	
 10734	"'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,'
 10735	said he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money
 10736	in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try
 10737	other means.'
 10738	
 10739	"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the
 10740	month. 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I cried, on which
 10741	he bowed and left the room without another word.
 10742	
 10743	"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my
 10744	treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go
 10745	round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I
 10746	usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform
 10747	myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself
 10748	at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as
 10749	I approached.
 10750	
 10751	"'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little
 10752	disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out
 10753	to-night?'
 10754	
 10755	"'Certainly not.'
 10756	
 10757	"'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she
 10758	has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that
 10759	it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'
 10760	
 10761	"'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer
 10762	it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'
 10763	
 10764	"'Quite sure, dad.'
 10765	
 10766	"'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom
 10767	again, where I was soon asleep.
 10768	
 10769	"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may
 10770	have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question
 10771	me upon any point which I do not make clear."
 10772	
 10773	"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."
 10774	
 10775	"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be
 10776	particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety
 10777	in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.
 10778	About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in
 10779	the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an
 10780	impression behind it as though a window had gently closed
 10781	somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my
 10782	horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in
 10783	the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,
 10784	and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.
 10785	
 10786	"'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you
 10787	touch that coronet?'
 10788	
 10789	"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,
 10790	dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the
 10791	light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be
 10792	wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry
 10793	he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I
 10794	snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with
 10795	three of the beryls in it, was missing.
 10796	
 10797	"'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have
 10798	destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the
 10799	jewels which you have stolen?'
 10800	
 10801	"'Stolen!' he cried.
 10802	
 10803	"'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.
 10804	
 10805	"'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.
 10806	
 10807	"'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I
 10808	call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to
 10809	tear off another piece?'
 10810	
 10811	"'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it
 10812	any longer. I shall not say another word about this business,
 10813	since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in
 10814	the morning and make my own way in the world.'
 10815	
 10816	"'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried
 10817	half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to
 10818	the bottom.'
 10819	
 10820	"'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such
 10821	as I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to
 10822	call the police, let the police find what they can.'
 10823	
 10824	"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my
 10825	voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and,
 10826	at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the
 10827	whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the
 10828	ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the
 10829	investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a
 10830	constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with
 10831	his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge
 10832	him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private
 10833	matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was
 10834	national property. I was determined that the law should have its
 10835	way in everything.
 10836	
 10837	"'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It
 10838	would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the
 10839	house for five minutes.'
 10840	
 10841	"'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you
 10842	have stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position
 10843	in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only
 10844	my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at
 10845	stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would
 10846	convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell
 10847	me what he had done with the three missing stones.
 10848	
 10849	"'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught
 10850	in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.
 10851	If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling
 10852	us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'
 10853	
 10854	"'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered,
 10855	turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened
 10856	for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for
 10857	it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search
 10858	was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of
 10859	every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed
 10860	the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the
 10861	wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our
 10862	threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after
 10863	going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to
 10864	you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.
 10865	The police have openly confessed that they can at present make
 10866	nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think
 10867	necessary. I have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My
 10868	God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son
 10869	in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"
 10870	
 10871	He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to
 10872	and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got
 10873	beyond words.
 10874	
 10875	Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows
 10876	knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.
 10877	
 10878	"Do you receive much company?" he asked.
 10879	
 10880	"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of
 10881	Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No
 10882	one else, I think."
 10883	
 10884	"Do you go out much in society?"
 10885	
 10886	"Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for
 10887	it."
 10888	
 10889	"That is unusual in a young girl."
 10890	
 10891	"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She
 10892	is four-and-twenty."
 10893	
 10894	"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to
 10895	her also."
 10896	
 10897	"Terrible! She is even more affected than I."
 10898	
 10899	"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"
 10900	
 10901	"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet
 10902	in his hands."
 10903	
 10904	"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of
 10905	the coronet at all injured?"
 10906	
 10907	"Yes, it was twisted."
 10908	
 10909	"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to
 10910	straighten it?"
 10911	
 10912	"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me.
 10913	But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If
 10914	his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"
 10915	
 10916	"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?
 10917	His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several
 10918	singular points about the case. What did the police think of the
 10919	noise which awoke you from your sleep?"
 10920	
 10921	"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his
 10922	bedroom door."
 10923	
 10924	"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door
 10925	so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the
 10926	disappearance of these gems?"
 10927	
 10928	"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture
 10929	in the hope of finding them."
 10930	
 10931	"Have they thought of looking outside the house?"
 10932	
 10933	"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has
 10934	already been minutely examined."
 10935	
 10936	"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes. "is it not obvious to you now
 10937	that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you
 10938	or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you
 10939	to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider
 10940	what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came
 10941	down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room,
 10942	opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main
 10943	force a small portion of it, went off to some other place,
 10944	concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that
 10945	nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six
 10946	into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger
 10947	of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"
 10948	
 10949	"But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of
 10950	despair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain
 10951	them?"
 10952	
 10953	"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if
 10954	you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together,
 10955	and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into
 10956	details."
 10957	
 10958	My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,
 10959	which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy
 10960	were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I
 10961	confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be
 10962	as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such
 10963	faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some
 10964	grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted
 10965	explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the
 10966	southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his
 10967	hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client
 10968	appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope
 10969	which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a
 10970	desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway
 10971	journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest
 10972	residence of the great financier.
 10973	
 10974	Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing
 10975	back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a
 10976	snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates
 10977	which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden
 10978	thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges
 10979	stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the
 10980	tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the
 10981	stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a
 10982	public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing
 10983	at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the
 10984	front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden
 10985	behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I
 10986	went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should
 10987	return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and
 10988	a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height,
 10989	slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against
 10990	the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever
 10991	seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were
 10992	bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept
 10993	silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of
 10994	grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the
 10995	more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong
 10996	character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding
 10997	my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand
 10998	over his head with a sweet womanly caress.
 10999	
 11000	"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you
 11001	not, dad?" she asked.
 11002	
 11003	"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."
 11004	
 11005	"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's
 11006	instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will
 11007	be sorry for having acted so harshly."
 11008	
 11009	"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"
 11010	
 11011	"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should
 11012	suspect him."
 11013	
 11014	"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with
 11015	the coronet in his hand?"
 11016	
 11017	"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take
 11018	my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say
 11019	no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in
 11020	prison!"
 11021	
 11022	"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary!
 11023	Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences
 11024	to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman
 11025	down from London to inquire more deeply into it."
 11026	
 11027	"This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.
 11028	
 11029	"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in
 11030	the stable lane now."
 11031	
 11032	"The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he
 11033	hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir,
 11034	that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth,
 11035	that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime."
 11036	
 11037	"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may
 11038	prove it," returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the
 11039	snow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing
 11040	Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?"
 11041	
 11042	"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."
 11043	
 11044	"You heard nothing yourself last night?"
 11045	
 11046	"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard
 11047	that, and I came down."
 11048	
 11049	"You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you
 11050	fasten all the windows?"
 11051	
 11052	"Yes."
 11053	
 11054	"Were they all fastened this morning?"
 11055	
 11056	"Yes."
 11057	
 11058	"You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked
 11059	to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?"
 11060	
 11061	"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and
 11062	who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet."
 11063	
 11064	"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her
 11065	sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery."
 11066	
 11067	"But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the
 11068	banker impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Arthur with
 11069	the coronet in his hands?"
 11070	
 11071	"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this
 11072	girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I
 11073	presume?"
 11074	
 11075	"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I
 11076	met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."
 11077	
 11078	"Do you know him?"
 11079	
 11080	"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.
 11081	His name is Francis Prosper."
 11082	
 11083	"He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to
 11084	say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"
 11085	
 11086	"Yes, he did."
 11087	
 11088	"And he is a man with a wooden leg?"
 11089	
 11090	Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive
 11091	black eyes. "Why, you are like a magician," said she. "How do you
 11092	know that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in
 11093	Holmes' thin, eager face.
 11094	
 11095	"I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall
 11096	probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps
 11097	I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up."
 11098	
 11099	He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at
 11100	the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.
 11101	This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill
 11102	with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs,"
 11103	said he at last.
 11104	
 11105	The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little
 11106	chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.
 11107	Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.
 11108	
 11109	"Which key was used to open it?" he asked.
 11110	
 11111	"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the
 11112	lumber-room."
 11113	
 11114	"Have you it here?"
 11115	
 11116	"That is it on the dressing-table."
 11117	
 11118	Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.
 11119	
 11120	"It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did
 11121	not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must
 11122	have a look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the diadem
 11123	he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the
 11124	jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I
 11125	have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge,
 11126	where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.
 11127	
 11128	"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which
 11129	corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I
 11130	beg that you will break it off."
 11131	
 11132	The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying,"
 11133	said he.
 11134	
 11135	"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but
 11136	without result. "I feel it give a little," said he; "but, though
 11137	I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my
 11138	time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do
 11139	you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would
 11140	be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this
 11141	happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard
 11142	nothing of it?"
 11143	
 11144	"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."
 11145	
 11146	"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think,
 11147	Miss Holder?"
 11148	
 11149	"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."
 11150	
 11151	"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"
 11152	
 11153	"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."
 11154	
 11155	"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary
 11156	luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault
 11157	if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your
 11158	permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations
 11159	outside."
 11160	
 11161	He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any
 11162	unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an
 11163	hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet
 11164	heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.
 11165	
 11166	"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.
 11167	Holder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my
 11168	rooms."
 11169	
 11170	"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"
 11171	
 11172	"I cannot tell."
 11173	
 11174	The banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he
 11175	cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"
 11176	
 11177	"My opinion is in no way altered."
 11178	
 11179	"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was
 11180	acted in my house last night?"
 11181	
 11182	"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow
 11183	morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to
 11184	make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to
 11185	act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you
 11186	place no limit on the sum I may draw."
 11187	
 11188	"I would give my fortune to have them back."
 11189	
 11190	"Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.
 11191	Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here
 11192	again before evening."
 11193	
 11194	It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up
 11195	about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than
 11196	I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward
 11197	journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always
 11198	glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in
 11199	despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our
 11200	rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in
 11201	a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned
 11202	up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he
 11203	was a perfect sample of the class.
 11204	
 11205	"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass
 11206	above the fireplace. "I only wish that you could come with me,
 11207	Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in
 11208	this matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I
 11209	shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few
 11210	hours." He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard,
 11211	sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this
 11212	rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.
 11213	
 11214	I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in
 11215	excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his
 11216	hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a
 11217	cup of tea.
 11218	
 11219	"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."
 11220	
 11221	"Where to?"
 11222	
 11223	"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time
 11224	before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be
 11225	late."
 11226	
 11227	"How are you getting on?"
 11228	
 11229	"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham
 11230	since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a
 11231	very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a
 11232	good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get
 11233	these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly
 11234	respectable self."
 11235	
 11236	I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for
 11237	satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled,
 11238	and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He
 11239	hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of
 11240	the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his
 11241	congenial hunt.
 11242	
 11243	I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so
 11244	I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away
 11245	for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that
 11246	his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he
 11247	came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there
 11248	he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the
 11249	other, as fresh and trim as possible.
 11250	
 11251	"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but
 11252	you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this
 11253	morning."
 11254	
 11255	"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be
 11256	surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."
 11257	
 11258	It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the
 11259	change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally
 11260	of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in,
 11261	while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered
 11262	with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than
 11263	his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into
 11264	the armchair which I pushed forward for him.
 11265	
 11266	"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said
 11267	he. "Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without
 11268	a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured
 11269	age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece,
 11270	Mary, has deserted me."
 11271	
 11272	"Deserted you?"
 11273	
 11274	"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was
 11275	empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to
 11276	her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had
 11277	married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was
 11278	thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers
 11279	in this note:
 11280	
 11281	"'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,
 11282	and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune
 11283	might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my
 11284	mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must
 11285	leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is
 11286	provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will
 11287	be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in       
 11288	death, I am ever your loving,--MARY.'
 11289	
 11290	"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it
 11291	points to suicide?"
 11292	
 11293	"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible
 11294	solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of
 11295	your troubles."
 11296	
 11297	"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have
 11298	learned something! Where are the gems?"
 11299	
 11300	"You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for
 11301	them?"
 11302	
 11303	"I would pay ten."
 11304	
 11305	"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter.
 11306	And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book?
 11307	Here is a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds."
 11308	
 11309	With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes
 11310	walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of
 11311	gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.
 11312	
 11313	With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
 11314	
 11315	"You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"
 11316	
 11317	The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and
 11318	he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.
 11319	
 11320	"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock
 11321	Holmes rather sternly.
 11322	
 11323	"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."
 11324	
 11325	"No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that
 11326	noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I
 11327	should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to
 11328	have one."
 11329	
 11330	"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"
 11331	
 11332	"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not."
 11333	
 11334	"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him
 11335	know that the truth is known."
 11336	
 11337	"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an
 11338	interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the
 11339	story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was
 11340	right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite
 11341	clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his
 11342	lips."
 11343	
 11344	"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary
 11345	mystery!"
 11346	
 11347	"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached
 11348	it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me
 11349	to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding
 11350	between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now
 11351	fled together."
 11352	
 11353	"My Mary? Impossible!"
 11354	
 11355	"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither
 11356	you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you
 11357	admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most
 11358	dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely
 11359	desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece
 11360	knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he
 11361	had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she
 11362	alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said,
 11363	but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing
 11364	him nearly every evening."
 11365	
 11366	"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an
 11367	ashen face.
 11368	
 11369	"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.
 11370	Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room,
 11371	slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which
 11372	leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right
 11373	through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the
 11374	coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he
 11375	bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but
 11376	there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all
 11377	other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had
 11378	hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
 11379	downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you
 11380	about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover,
 11381	which was all perfectly true.
 11382	
 11383	"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but
 11384	he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.
 11385	In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door,
 11386	so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin
 11387	walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared
 11388	into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad
 11389	slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what
 11390	would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the
 11391	room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw
 11392	that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed
 11393	down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and
 11394	slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see
 11395	what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the
 11396	window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then
 11397	closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close
 11398	to where he stood hid behind the curtain.
 11399	
 11400	"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action
 11401	without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the
 11402	instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune
 11403	this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it
 11404	right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened
 11405	the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,
 11406	where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George
 11407	Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was
 11408	a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the
 11409	coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son
 11410	struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something
 11411	suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet
 11412	in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your
 11413	room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in
 11414	the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you
 11415	appeared upon the scene."
 11416	
 11417	"Is it possible?" gasped the banker.
 11418	
 11419	"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when
 11420	he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not
 11421	explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who
 11422	certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He
 11423	took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her
 11424	secret."
 11425	
 11426	"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the
 11427	coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have
 11428	been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!
 11429	The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the
 11430	scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"
 11431	
 11432	"When I arrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went
 11433	very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in
 11434	the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since
 11435	the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost
 11436	to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but
 11437	found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,
 11438	however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood
 11439	and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed
 11440	that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been
 11441	disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was
 11442	shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had
 11443	waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time
 11444	that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had
 11445	already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed
 11446	round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,
 11447	which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable
 11448	lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in
 11449	front of me.
 11450	
 11451	"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second
 11452	double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked
 11453	feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the
 11454	latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the
 11455	other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over
 11456	the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed
 11457	after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the
 11458	hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while
 11459	waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred
 11460	yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round,
 11461	where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,
 11462	and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me
 11463	that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and
 11464	another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been
 11465	hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that
 11466	the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.
 11467	
 11468	"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the
 11469	sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could
 11470	at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the
 11471	outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming
 11472	in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what
 11473	had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had
 11474	brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had
 11475	pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged
 11476	at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which
 11477	neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the
 11478	prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So
 11479	far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who
 11480	was it brought him the coronet?
 11481	
 11482	"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
 11483	impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
 11484	truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down,
 11485	so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were
 11486	the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in
 11487	their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his
 11488	cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should
 11489	retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful
 11490	one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and
 11491	how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture
 11492	became a certainty.
 11493	
 11494	"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently,
 11495	for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must
 11496	feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your
 11497	circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir
 11498	George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil
 11499	reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots
 11500	and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur
 11501	had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was
 11502	safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his
 11503	own family.
 11504	
 11505	"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took
 11506	next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house,
 11507	managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that
 11508	his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at
 11509	the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of
 11510	his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and
 11511	saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."
 11512	
 11513	"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,"
 11514	said Mr. Holder.
 11515	
 11516	"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home
 11517	and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to
 11518	play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert
 11519	scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our
 11520	hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of
 11521	course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every
 11522	particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a
 11523	life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I
 11524	clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he
 11525	became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give
 11526	him a price for the stones he held--1000 pounds apiece. That
 11527	brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why,
 11528	dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the
 11529	three!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had
 11530	them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I
 11531	set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000
 11532	pounds apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all
 11533	was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after
 11534	what I may call a really hard day's work."
 11535	
 11536	"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said
 11537	the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but
 11538	you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your
 11539	skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I
 11540	must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I
 11541	have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my
 11542	very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."
 11543	
 11544	"I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is
 11545	wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that
 11546	whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than
 11547	sufficient punishment."
 11548	
 11549	
 11550	
 11551	XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
 11552	
 11553	"To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock
 11554	Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily
 11555	Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest
 11556	manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is
 11557	pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped
 11558	this truth that in these little records of our cases which you
 11559	have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,
 11560	occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much
 11561	to the many causes c?l?bres and sensational trials in which I
 11562	have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
 11563	trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those
 11564	faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made
 11565	my special province."
 11566	
 11567	"And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved
 11568	from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my
 11569	records."
 11570	
 11571	"You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing
 11572	cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood
 11573	pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a
 11574	disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred
 11575	perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your
 11576	statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing
 11577	upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is
 11578	really the only notable feature about the thing."
 11579	
 11580	"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,"
 11581	I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism
 11582	which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my
 11583	friend's singular character.
 11584	
 11585	"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as
 11586	was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full
 11587	justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a
 11588	thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it
 11589	is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should
 11590	dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of
 11591	lectures into a series of tales."
 11592	
 11593	It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after
 11594	breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at
 11595	Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of
 11596	dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark,
 11597	shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit
 11598	and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for
 11599	the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been
 11600	silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the
 11601	advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,
 11602	having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very
 11603	sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
 11604	
 11605	"At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he
 11606	had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire,
 11607	"you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of
 11608	these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself
 11609	in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense,
 11610	at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King
 11611	of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the
 11612	problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the
 11613	incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are
 11614	outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I
 11615	fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."
 11616	
 11617	"The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold
 11618	to have been novel and of interest."
 11619	
 11620	"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant
 11621	public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a
 11622	compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of
 11623	analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot
 11624	blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at
 11625	least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As
 11626	to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an
 11627	agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to
 11628	young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched
 11629	bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my
 11630	zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across
 11631	to me.
 11632	
 11633	It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and
 11634	ran thus:
 11635	
 11636	"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether
 11637	I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered
 11638	to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I
 11639	do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,
 11640	                                               "VIOLET HUNTER."
 11641	
 11642	"Do you know the young lady?" I asked.
 11643	
 11644	"Not I."
 11645	
 11646	"It is half-past ten now."
 11647	
 11648	"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."
 11649	
 11650	"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You
 11651	remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to
 11652	be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation.
 11653	It may be so in this case, also."
 11654	
 11655	"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved,
 11656	for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question."
 11657	
 11658	As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.
 11659	She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face,
 11660	freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a
 11661	woman who has had her own way to make in the world.
 11662	
 11663	"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my
 11664	companion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very strange
 11665	experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort
 11666	from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be
 11667	kind enough to tell me what I should do."
 11668	
 11669	"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything
 11670	that I can to serve you."
 11671	
 11672	I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner
 11673	and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching
 11674	fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and
 11675	his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.
 11676	
 11677	"I have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the
 11678	family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel
 11679	received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his
 11680	children over to America with him, so that I found myself without
 11681	a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but
 11682	without success. At last the little money which I had saved began
 11683	to run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.
 11684	
 11685	"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End
 11686	called Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in
 11687	order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me.
 11688	Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is
 11689	really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office,
 11690	and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom,
 11691	and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers
 11692	and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.
 11693	
 11694	"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office
 11695	as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A
 11696	prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy
 11697	chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at
 11698	her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very
 11699	earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a
 11700	jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.
 11701	
 11702	"'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better.
 11703	Capital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his
 11704	hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a
 11705	comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at
 11706	him.
 11707	
 11708	"'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.
 11709	
 11710	"'Yes, sir.'
 11711	
 11712	"'As governess?'
 11713	
 11714	"'Yes, sir.'
 11715	
 11716	"'And what salary do you ask?'
 11717	
 11718	"'I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence
 11719	Munro.'
 11720	
 11721	"'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his
 11722	fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling
 11723	passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with
 11724	such attractions and accomplishments?'
 11725	
 11726	"'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I.
 11727	'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--'
 11728	
 11729	"'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question.
 11730	The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment
 11731	of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are
 11732	not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a
 11733	considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have
 11734	why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to
 11735	accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me,
 11736	madam, would commence at 100 pounds a year.'
 11737	
 11738	"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was,
 11739	such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman,
 11740	however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face,
 11741	opened a pocket-book and took out a note.
 11742	
 11743	"'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant
 11744	fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid
 11745	the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies
 11746	half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little
 11747	expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'
 11748	
 11749	"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so
 11750	thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the
 11751	advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something
 11752	unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know
 11753	a little more before I quite committed myself.
 11754	
 11755	"'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.
 11756	
 11757	"'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles
 11758	on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my
 11759	dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'
 11760	
 11761	"'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would
 11762	be.'
 11763	
 11764	"'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if
 11765	you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack!
 11766	smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back
 11767	in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.
 11768	
 11769	"I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement,
 11770	but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was
 11771	joking.
 11772	
 11773	"'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single
 11774	child?'
 11775	
 11776	"'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he
 11777	cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would
 11778	suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided
 11779	always that they were such commands as a lady might with
 11780	propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?'
 11781	
 11782	"'I should be happy to make myself useful.'
 11783	
 11784	"'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you
 11785	know--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress
 11786	which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.
 11787	Heh?'
 11788	
 11789	"'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.
 11790	
 11791	"'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to
 11792	you?'
 11793	
 11794	"'Oh, no.'
 11795	
 11796	"'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'
 11797	
 11798	"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes,
 11799	my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of
 11800	chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of
 11801	sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.
 11802	
 11803	"'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been
 11804	watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a
 11805	shadow pass over his face as I spoke.
 11806	
 11807	"'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a
 11808	little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam,
 11809	ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your
 11810	hair?'
 11811	
 11812	"'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.
 11813	
 11814	"'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a
 11815	pity, because in other respects you would really have done very
 11816	nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more
 11817	of your young ladies.'
 11818	
 11819	"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers
 11820	without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so
 11821	much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting
 11822	that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.
 11823	
 11824	"'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked.
 11825	
 11826	"'If you please, Miss Stoper.'
 11827	
 11828	"'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the
 11829	most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You
 11830	can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such
 11831	opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong
 11832	upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.
 11833	
 11834	"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found
 11835	little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the
 11836	table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very
 11837	foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and
 11838	expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were
 11839	at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few
 11840	governesses in England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides,
 11841	what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing
 11842	it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was
 11843	inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after
 11844	I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go
 11845	back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open
 11846	when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it
 11847	here and I will read it to you:
 11848	
 11849	                       "'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.
 11850	"'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your
 11851	address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have
 11852	reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you
 11853	should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of
 11854	you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a
 11855	year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which
 11856	our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My
 11857	wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would
 11858	like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need
 11859	not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one
 11860	belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which
 11861	would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting
 11862	here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that
 11863	need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no
 11864	doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty
 11865	during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain
 11866	firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary
 11867	may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child
 11868	is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall
 11869	meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train.
 11870	Yours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'
 11871	
 11872	"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and
 11873	my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however,
 11874	that before taking the final step I should like to submit the
 11875	whole matter to your consideration."
 11876	
 11877	"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the
 11878	question," said Holmes, smiling.
 11879	
 11880	"But you would not advise me to refuse?"
 11881	
 11882	"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to
 11883	see a sister of mine apply for."
 11884	
 11885	"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"
 11886	
 11887	"Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself
 11888	formed some opinion?"
 11889	
 11890	"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr.
 11891	Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not
 11892	possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the
 11893	matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that
 11894	he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an
 11895	outbreak?"
 11896	
 11897	"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is
 11898	the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a
 11899	nice household for a young lady."
 11900	
 11901	"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!"
 11902	
 11903	"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what
 11904	makes me uneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when
 11905	they could have their pick for 40 pounds? There must be some
 11906	strong reason behind."
 11907	
 11908	"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would
 11909	understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so
 11910	much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."
 11911	
 11912	"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that
 11913	your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has
 11914	come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel
 11915	about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt
 11916	or in danger--"
 11917	
 11918	"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"
 11919	
 11920	Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if
 11921	we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a
 11922	telegram would bring me down to your help."
 11923	
 11924	"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the
 11925	anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire
 11926	quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once,
 11927	sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester
 11928	to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both
 11929	good-night and bustled off upon her way.
 11930	
 11931	"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending
 11932	the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able
 11933	to take care of herself."
 11934	
 11935	"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much
 11936	mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."
 11937	
 11938	It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled.
 11939	A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts
 11940	turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of
 11941	human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual
 11942	salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to
 11943	something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether
 11944	the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond
 11945	my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat
 11946	frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an
 11947	abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his
 11948	hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried
 11949	impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would
 11950	always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever
 11951	have accepted such a situation.
 11952	
 11953	The telegram which we eventually received came late one night
 11954	just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down
 11955	to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently
 11956	indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a
 11957	test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came
 11958	down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope,
 11959	and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.
 11960	
 11961	"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back
 11962	to his chemical studies.
 11963	
 11964	The summons was a brief and urgent one.
 11965	
 11966	"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday
 11967	to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.  HUNTER."
 11968	
 11969	"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.
 11970	
 11971	"I should wish to."
 11972	
 11973	"Just look it up, then."
 11974	
 11975	"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my
 11976	Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."
 11977	
 11978	"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my
 11979	analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the
 11980	morning."
 11981	
 11982	By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the
 11983	old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers
 11984	all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he
 11985	threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal
 11986	spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white
 11987	clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining
 11988	very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air,
 11989	which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside,
 11990	away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and
 11991	grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light
 11992	green of the new foliage.
 11993	
 11994	"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the
 11995	enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.
 11996	
 11997	But Holmes shook his head gravely.
 11998	
 11999	"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of
 12000	a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with
 12001	reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered
 12002	houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them,
 12003	and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their
 12004	isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed
 12005	there."
 12006	
 12007	"Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these
 12008	dear old homesteads?"
 12009	
 12010	"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,
 12011	Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest
 12012	alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin
 12013	than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."
 12014	
 12015	"You horrify me!"
 12016	
 12017	"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion
 12018	can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no
 12019	lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of
 12020	a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among
 12021	the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever
 12022	so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is
 12023	but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these
 12024	lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part
 12025	with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the
 12026	deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on,
 12027	year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this
 12028	lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I
 12029	should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of
 12030	country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is
 12031	not personally threatened."
 12032	
 12033	"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away."
 12034	
 12035	"Quite so. She has her freedom."
 12036	
 12037	"What CAN be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"
 12038	
 12039	"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would
 12040	cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is
 12041	correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we
 12042	shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of
 12043	the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has
 12044	to tell."
 12045	
 12046	The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no
 12047	distance from the station, and there we found the young lady
 12048	waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch
 12049	awaited us upon the table.
 12050	
 12051	"I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It
 12052	is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I
 12053	should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."
 12054	
 12055	"Pray tell us what has happened to you."
 12056	
 12057	"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.
 12058	Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into
 12059	town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."
 12060	
 12061	"Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his long
 12062	thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.
 12063	
 12064	"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole,
 12065	with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is
 12066	only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and
 12067	I am not easy in my mind about them."
 12068	
 12069	"What can you not understand?"
 12070	
 12071	"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just
 12072	as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and
 12073	drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he
 12074	said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself,
 12075	for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all
 12076	stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds
 12077	round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which
 12078	slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about
 12079	a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs
 12080	to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord
 12081	Southerton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in
 12082	front of the hall door has given its name to the place.
 12083	
 12084	"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever,
 12085	and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.
 12086	There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to
 12087	us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is
 12088	not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much
 12089	younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think,
 12090	while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their
 12091	conversation I have gathered that they have been married about
 12092	seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by
 12093	the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr.
 12094	Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them
 12095	was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As
 12096	the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite
 12097	imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her
 12098	father's young wife.
 12099	
 12100	"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as
 12101	in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.
 12102	She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately
 12103	devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey
 12104	eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every
 12105	little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her
 12106	also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they
 12107	seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow,
 12108	this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the
 12109	saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her
 12110	in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of
 12111	her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so
 12112	utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small
 12113	for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.
 12114	His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between
 12115	savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving
 12116	pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea
 12117	of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning
 12118	the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would
 12119	rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he
 12120	has little to do with my story."
 12121	
 12122	"I am glad of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they
 12123	seem to you to be relevant or not."
 12124	
 12125	"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one
 12126	unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was
 12127	the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a
 12128	man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough,
 12129	uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual
 12130	smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been
 12131	quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it.
 12132	His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as
 12133	silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most
 12134	unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the
 12135	nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one
 12136	corner of the building.
 12137	
 12138	"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was
 12139	very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after
 12140	breakfast and whispered something to her husband.
 12141	
 12142	"'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to
 12143	you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut
 12144	your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest
 12145	iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue
 12146	dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in
 12147	your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should
 12148	both be extremely obliged.'
 12149	
 12150	"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade
 12151	of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it
 12152	bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not
 12153	have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr.
 12154	and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which
 12155	seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for
 12156	me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching
 12157	along the entire front of the house, with three long windows
 12158	reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the
 12159	central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was
 12160	asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the
 12161	other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest
 12162	stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how
 12163	comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs.
 12164	Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so
 12165	much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad,
 12166	anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle
 12167	suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the
 12168	day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in
 12169	the nursery.
 12170	
 12171	"Two days later this same performance was gone through under
 12172	exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I
 12173	sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny
 12174	stories of which my employer had an immense r?pertoire, and which
 12175	he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and
 12176	moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not
 12177	fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for
 12178	about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then
 12179	suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and
 12180	to change my dress.
 12181	
 12182	"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to
 12183	what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly
 12184	be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face
 12185	away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire
 12186	to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be
 12187	impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been
 12188	broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of
 12189	the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst
 12190	of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able
 12191	with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I
 12192	confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that
 12193	was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I
 12194	perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road,
 12195	a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in
 12196	my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are
 12197	usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the
 12198	railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I
 12199	lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her
 12200	eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing,
 12201	but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my
 12202	hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.
 12203	
 12204	"'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the
 12205	road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'
 12206	
 12207	"'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.
 12208	
 12209	"'No, I know no one in these parts.'
 12210	
 12211	"'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to
 12212	him to go away.'
 12213	
 12214	"'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'
 12215	
 12216	"'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn
 12217	round and wave him away like that.'
 12218	
 12219	"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew
 12220	down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have
 12221	not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor
 12222	seen the man in the road."
 12223	
 12224	"Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a
 12225	most interesting one."
 12226	
 12227	"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may
 12228	prove to be little relation between the different incidents of
 12229	which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper
 12230	Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands
 12231	near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp
 12232	rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving
 12233	about.
 12234	
 12235	"'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two
 12236	planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'
 12237	
 12238	"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a
 12239	vague figure huddled up in the darkness.
 12240	
 12241	"'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start
 12242	which I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine,
 12243	but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do
 12244	anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then,
 12245	so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose
 12246	every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs
 12247	upon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your
 12248	foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life
 12249	is worth.'
 12250	
 12251	"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to
 12252	look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning.
 12253	It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the
 12254	house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was
 12255	standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was
 12256	aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper
 12257	beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It
 12258	was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging
 12259	jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly
 12260	across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.
 12261	That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not
 12262	think that any burglar could have done.
 12263	
 12264	"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as
 12265	you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a
 12266	great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the
 12267	child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the
 12268	furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things.
 12269	There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones
 12270	empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two
 12271	with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was
 12272	naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It
 12273	struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight,
 12274	so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very
 12275	first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There
 12276	was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never
 12277	guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.
 12278	
 12279	"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint,
 12280	and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing
 12281	obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in
 12282	the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the
 12283	contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two
 12284	tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was
 12285	it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at
 12286	all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer,
 12287	and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that
 12288	I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had
 12289	locked.
 12290	
 12291	"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes,
 12292	and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.
 12293	There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited
 12294	at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of
 12295	the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked.
 12296	One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle
 12297	coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on
 12298	his face which made him a very different person to the round,
 12299	jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his
 12300	brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his
 12301	temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me
 12302	without a word or a look.
 12303	
 12304	"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the
 12305	grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I
 12306	could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four
 12307	of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the
 12308	fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I
 12309	strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle
 12310	came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.
 12311	
 12312	"'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you
 12313	without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with
 12314	business matters.'
 12315	
 12316	"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I,
 12317	'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one
 12318	of them has the shutters up.'
 12319	
 12320	"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled
 12321	at my remark.
 12322	
 12323	"'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my
 12324	dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we
 12325	have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever
 12326	believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest
 12327	in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and
 12328	annoyance, but no jest.
 12329	
 12330	"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there
 12331	was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know,
 12332	I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity,
 12333	though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a
 12334	feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this
 12335	place. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's
 12336	instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,
 12337	and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the
 12338	forbidden door.
 12339	
 12340	"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,
 12341	besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to
 12342	do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large
 12343	black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been
 12344	drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when
 12345	I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at
 12346	all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both
 12347	downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an
 12348	admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock,
 12349	opened the door, and slipped through.
 12350	
 12351	"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and
 12352	uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.
 12353	Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third
 12354	of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and
 12355	cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so
 12356	thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through
 12357	them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it
 12358	had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked
 12359	at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with
 12360	stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was
 12361	not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the
 12362	shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from
 12363	beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was
 12364	a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the
 12365	passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it
 12366	might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room
 12367	and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little
 12368	slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad,
 12369	unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My
 12370	overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran
 12371	as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the
 12372	skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door,
 12373	and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting
 12374	outside.
 12375	
 12376	"'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it
 12377	must be when I saw the door open.'
 12378	
 12379	"'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.
 12380	
 12381	"'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how
 12382	caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened
 12383	you, my dear young lady?'
 12384	
 12385	"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I
 12386	was keenly on my guard against him.
 12387	
 12388	"'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered.
 12389	'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was
 12390	frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in
 12391	there!'
 12392	
 12393	"'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.
 12394	
 12395	"'Why, what did you think?' I asked.
 12396	
 12397	"'Why do you think that I lock this door?'
 12398	
 12399	"'I am sure that I do not know.'
 12400	
 12401	"'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you
 12402	see?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.
 12403	
 12404	"'I am sure if I had known--'
 12405	
 12406	"'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over
 12407	that threshold again'--here in an instant the smile hardened into
 12408	a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a
 12409	demon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'
 12410	
 12411	"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that
 12412	I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing
 12413	until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I
 12414	thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without
 12415	some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the
 12416	woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible
 12417	to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of
 12418	course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was
 12419	almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would
 12420	send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the
 12421	office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then
 12422	returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my
 12423	mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I
 12424	remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of
 12425	insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one
 12426	in the household who had any influence with the savage creature,
 12427	or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and
 12428	lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you.
 12429	I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this
 12430	morning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and
 12431	Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the
 12432	evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you
 12433	all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you
 12434	could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should
 12435	do."
 12436	
 12437	Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.
 12438	My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in
 12439	his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon
 12440	his face.
 12441	
 12442	"Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.
 12443	
 12444	"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do
 12445	nothing with him."
 12446	
 12447	"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"
 12448	
 12449	"Yes."
 12450	
 12451	"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"
 12452	
 12453	"Yes, the wine-cellar."
 12454	
 12455	"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very
 12456	brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could
 12457	perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not
 12458	think you a quite exceptional woman."
 12459	
 12460	"I will try. What is it?"
 12461	
 12462	"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend
 12463	and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will,
 12464	we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might
 12465	give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some
 12466	errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate
 12467	matters immensely."
 12468	
 12469	"I will do it."
 12470	
 12471	"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of
 12472	course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been
 12473	brought there to personate someone, and the real person is
 12474	imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this
 12475	prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice
 12476	Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to
 12477	America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height,
 12478	figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very
 12479	possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of
 12480	course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you
 12481	came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some
 12482	friend of hers--possibly her fianc?--and no doubt, as you wore
 12483	the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your
 12484	laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture,
 12485	that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer
 12486	desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent
 12487	him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly
 12488	clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of
 12489	the child."
 12490	
 12491	"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.
 12492	
 12493	"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining
 12494	light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the
 12495	parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have
 12496	frequently gained my first real insight into the character of
 12497	parents by studying their children. This child's disposition is
 12498	abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he
 12499	derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or
 12500	from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their
 12501	power."
 12502	
 12503	"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A
 12504	thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you
 12505	have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to
 12506	this poor creature."
 12507	
 12508	"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning
 12509	man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall
 12510	be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the
 12511	mystery."
 12512	
 12513	We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we
 12514	reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside
 12515	public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining
 12516	like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were
 12517	sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been
 12518	standing smiling on the door-step.
 12519	
 12520	"Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.
 12521	
 12522	A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is
 12523	Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring
 12524	on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates
 12525	of Mr. Rucastle's."
 12526	
 12527	"You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now
 12528	lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black
 12529	business."
 12530	
 12531	We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a
 12532	passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss
 12533	Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the
 12534	transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but
 12535	without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence
 12536	Holmes' face clouded over.
 12537	
 12538	"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss
 12539	Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put
 12540	your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our
 12541	way in."
 12542	
 12543	It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united
 12544	strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There
 12545	was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a
 12546	basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner
 12547	gone.
 12548	
 12549	"There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty
 12550	has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim
 12551	off."
 12552	
 12553	"But how?"
 12554	
 12555	"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He
 12556	swung himself up onto the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the
 12557	end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did
 12558	it."
 12559	
 12560	"But it is impossible," said Miss Hunter; "the ladder was not
 12561	there when the Rucastles went away."
 12562	
 12563	"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and
 12564	dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were
 12565	he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it
 12566	would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."
 12567	
 12568	The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at
 12569	the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy
 12570	stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the
 12571	wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and
 12572	confronted him.
 12573	
 12574	"You villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"
 12575	
 12576	The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open
 12577	skylight.
 12578	
 12579	"It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies
 12580	and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll
 12581	serve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he
 12582	could go.
 12583	
 12584	"He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunter.
 12585	
 12586	"I have my revolver," said I.
 12587	
 12588	"Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed
 12589	down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we
 12590	heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a
 12591	horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An
 12592	elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out
 12593	at a side door.
 12594	
 12595	"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been
 12596	fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"
 12597	
 12598	Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with
 12599	Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its
 12600	black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and
 12601	screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and
 12602	it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great
 12603	creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and
 12604	carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid
 12605	him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered
 12606	Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to
 12607	relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door
 12608	opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.
 12609	
 12610	"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.
 12611	
 12612	"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he
 12613	went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know
 12614	what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains
 12615	were wasted."
 12616	
 12617	"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs.
 12618	Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else."
 12619	
 12620	"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."
 12621	
 12622	"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several
 12623	points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."
 12624	
 12625	"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done
 12626	so before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's
 12627	police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the
 12628	one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend
 12629	too.
 12630	
 12631	"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time
 12632	that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no
 12633	say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until
 12634	after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could
 12635	learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so
 12636	quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them
 12637	but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was
 12638	safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming
 12639	forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then
 12640	her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to
 12641	sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use
 12642	her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until
 12643	she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then
 12644	she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her
 12645	beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her
 12646	young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."
 12647	
 12648	"Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough
 12649	to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce
 12650	all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this
 12651	system of imprisonment?"
 12652	
 12653	"Yes, sir."
 12654	
 12655	"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of
 12656	the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."
 12657	
 12658	"That was it, sir."
 12659	
 12660	"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should
 12661	be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain
 12662	arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your
 12663	interests were the same as his."
 12664	
 12665	"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said
 12666	Mrs. Toller serenely.
 12667	
 12668	"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no
 12669	want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment
 12670	when your master had gone out."
 12671	
 12672	"You have it, sir, just as it happened."
 12673	
 12674	"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for
 12675	you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And
 12676	here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,
 12677	Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,
 12678	as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a
 12679	questionable one."
 12680	
 12681	And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the
 12682	copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but
 12683	was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of
 12684	his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who
 12685	probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it
 12686	difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were
 12687	married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their
 12688	flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in
 12689	the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend
 12690	Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further
 12691	interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
 12692	of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
 12693	Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.
 12694

 12705	Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
 12706	editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
 12707	unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
 12708	keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
 12709	
 12710	We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
 12711	of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
 12712	Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
 12713	even years after the official publication date.

 12715	Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til

 12731	Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
 12732	can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is

 12748	We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
 12749	time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
 12750	to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
 12751	searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
 12752	projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
 12753	per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
 12754	million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
 12755	files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
 12756	We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
 12757	If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
 12758	will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.
 12759	
 12760	The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
 12761	This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
 12762	which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

 12882	is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
 12883	through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
 12884	Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
