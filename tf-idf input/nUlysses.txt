 13051	-- I --
 13052	
 13053	Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
 13054	lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown,
 13055	ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He
 13056	held the bowl aloft and intoned:
 13057	
 13058	--_Introibo ad altare Dei_.
 13059	
 13060	Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:
 13061	
 13062	--Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!
 13063	
 13064	Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about
 13065	and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the
 13066	awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent
 13067	towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
 13068	and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned
 13069	his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
 13070	gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light
 13071	untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.
 13072	
 13073	Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the
 13074	bowl smartly.
 13075	
 13076	--Back to barracks! he said sternly.
 13077	
 13078	He added in a preacher's tone:
 13079	
 13080	--For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul
 13081	and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One
 13082	moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.
 13083	
 13084	He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
 13085	awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there
 13086	with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered
 13087	through the calm.
 13088	
 13089	--Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off
 13090	the current, will you?
 13091	
 13092	He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering
 13093	about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and
 13094	sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.
 13095	A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.
 13096	
 13097	--The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!
 13098	
 13099	He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
 13100	laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
 13101	halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as
 13102	he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
 13103	lathered cheeks and neck.
 13104	
 13105	Buck Mulligan's gay voice went on.
 13106	
 13107	--My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a
 13108	Hellenic ring, hasn't it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.
 13109	We must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out
 13110	twenty quid?
 13111	
 13112	He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:
 13113	
 13114	--Will he come? The jejune jesuit!
 13115	
 13116	Ceasing, he began to shave with care.
 13117	
 13118	--Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.
 13119	
 13120	--Yes, my love?
 13121	
 13122	--How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?
 13123	
 13124	Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.
 13125	
 13126	--God, isn't he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks
 13127	you're not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money
 13128	and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you
 13129	have the real Oxford manner. He can't make you out. O, my name for you
 13130	is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.
 13131	
 13132	He shaved warily over his chin.
 13133	
 13134	--He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is
 13135	his guncase?
 13136	
 13137	--A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?
 13138	
 13139	--I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark
 13140	with a man I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a
 13141	black panther. You saved men from drowning. I'm not a hero, however. If
 13142	he stays on here I am off.
 13143	
 13144	Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down
 13145	from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.
 13146	
 13147	--Scutter! he cried thickly.
 13148	
 13149	He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen's upper
 13150	pocket, said:
 13151	
 13152	--Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.
 13153	
 13154	Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a
 13155	dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.
 13156	Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:
 13157	
 13158	--The bard's noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.
 13159	You can almost taste it, can't you?
 13160	
 13161	He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair
 13162	oakpale hair stirring slightly.
 13163	
 13164	--God! he said quietly. Isn't the sea what Algy calls it: a grey
 13165	sweet mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. _Epi oinopa
 13166	ponton_. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them
 13167	in the original. _Thalatta! Thalatta_! She is our great sweet mother.
 13168	Come and look.
 13169	
 13170	Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked
 13171	down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
 13172	Kingstown.
 13173	
 13174	--Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.
 13175	
 13176	He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's
 13177	face.
 13178	
 13179	--The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That's why she won't
 13180	let me have anything to do with you.
 13181	
 13182	--Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.
 13183	
 13184	--You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother
 13185	asked you, Buck Mulligan said. I'm hyperborean as much as you. But to
 13186	think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and
 13187	pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you...
 13188	
 13189	He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant
 13190	smile curled his lips.
 13191	
 13192	--But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest
 13193	mummer of them all!
 13194	
 13195	He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.
 13196	
 13197	Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
 13198	his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.
 13199	Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in
 13200	a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its
 13201	loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her
 13202	breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of
 13203	wetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a
 13204	great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay
 13205	and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had
 13206	stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had
 13207	torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.
 13208	
 13209	Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.
 13210	
 13211	--Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt
 13212	and a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?
 13213	
 13214	--They fit well enough, Stephen answered.
 13215	
 13216	Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.
 13217	
 13218	--The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God
 13219	knows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair
 13220	stripe, grey. You'll look spiffing in them. I'm not joking, Kinch. You
 13221	look damn well when you're dressed.
 13222	
 13223	--Thanks, Stephen said. I can't wear them if they are grey.
 13224	
 13225	--He can't wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.
 13226	Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can't wear grey
 13227	trousers.
 13228	
 13229	He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
 13230	smooth skin.
 13231	
 13232	Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
 13233	smokeblue mobile eyes.
 13234	
 13235	--That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,
 13236	says you have g.p.i. He's up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. General
 13237	paralysis of the insane!
 13238	
 13239	He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad
 13240	in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and
 13241	the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong
 13242	wellknit trunk.
 13243	
 13244	--Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!
 13245	
 13246	Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by
 13247	a crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this
 13248	face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.
 13249	
 13250	--I pinched it out of the skivvy's room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her
 13251	all right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead
 13252	him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.
 13253	
 13254	Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen's peering eyes.
 13255	
 13256	--The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If
 13257	Wilde were only alive to see you!
 13258	
 13259	Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:
 13260	
 13261	--It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked looking-glass of a servant.
 13262	
 13263	Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen's and walked with him
 13264	round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he
 13265	had thrust them.
 13266	
 13267	--It's not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.
 13268	God knows you have more spirit than any of them.
 13269	
 13270	Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The
 13271	cold steelpen.
 13272	
 13273	--Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap
 13274	downstairs and touch him for a guinea. He's stinking with money and
 13275	thinks you're not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling
 13276	jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I
 13277	could only work together we might do something for the island. Hellenise
 13278	it.
 13279	
 13280	Cranly's arm. His arm.
 13281	
 13282	--And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I'm the only one
 13283	that knows what you are. Why don't you trust me more? What have you
 13284	up your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I'll
 13285	bring down Seymour and we'll give him a ragging worse than they gave
 13286	Clive Kempthorpe.
 13287	
 13288	Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe's rooms. Palefaces:
 13289	they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall
 13290	expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit
 13291	ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the
 13292	table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the
 13293	tailor's shears. A scared calf's face gilded with marmalade. I don't
 13294	want to be debagged! Don't you play the giddy ox with me!
 13295	
 13296	Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf
 13297	gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold's face, pushes his mower
 13298	on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.
 13299	
 13300	To ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.
 13301	
 13302	--Let him stay, Stephen said. There's nothing wrong with him except at
 13303	night.
 13304	
 13305	--Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I'm
 13306	quite frank with you. What have you against me now?
 13307	
 13308	They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the
 13309	water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.
 13310	
 13311	--Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.
 13312	
 13313	--Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don't remember anything.
 13314	
 13315	He looked in Stephen's face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,
 13316	fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of
 13317	anxiety in his eyes.
 13318	
 13319	Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:
 13320	
 13321	--Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother's
 13322	death?
 13323	
 13324	Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:
 13325	
 13326	--What? Where? I can't remember anything. I remember only ideas and
 13327	sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?
 13328	
 13329	--You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to
 13330	get more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the
 13331	drawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.
 13332	
 13333	--Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.
 13334	
 13335	--You said, Stephen answered, _O, it's only Dedalus whose mother is
 13336	beastly dead._
 13337	
 13338	A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck
 13339	Mulligan's cheek.
 13340	
 13341	--Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?
 13342	
 13343	He shook his constraint from him nervously.
 13344	
 13345	--And what is death, he asked, your mother's or yours or my own? You
 13346	saw only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and
 13347	Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It's a beastly
 13348	thing and nothing else. It simply doesn't matter. You wouldn't kneel
 13349	down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why?
 13350	Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it's injected the
 13351	wrong way. To me it's all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes
 13352	are not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks
 13353	buttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it's over. You crossed her
 13354	last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don't whinge like
 13355	some hired mute from Lalouette's. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I
 13356	didn't mean to offend the memory of your mother.
 13357	
 13358	He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping
 13359	wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:
 13360	
 13361	--I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.
 13362	
 13363	--Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.
 13364	
 13365	--Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.
 13366	
 13367	Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.
 13368	
 13369	--O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.
 13370	
 13371	He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,
 13372	gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew
 13373	dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt
 13374	the fever of his cheeks.
 13375	
 13376	A voice within the tower called loudly:
 13377	
 13378	--Are you up there, Mulligan?
 13379	
 13380	--I'm coming, Buck Mulligan answered.
 13381	
 13382	He turned towards Stephen and said:
 13383	
 13384	--Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola,
 13385	Kinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.
 13386	
 13387	His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level
 13388	with the roof:
 13389	
 13390	--Don't mope over it all day, he said. I'm inconsequent. Give up the
 13391	moody brooding.
 13392	
 13393	His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
 13394	the stairhead:
 13395	
 13396	     _And no more turn aside and brood
 13397	     Upon love's bitter mystery
 13398	     For Fergus rules the brazen cars._
 13399	
 13400	
 13401	Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the
 13402	stairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of
 13403	water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of
 13404	the dim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the
 13405	harpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words
 13406	shimmering on the dim tide.
 13407	
 13408	A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in
 13409	deeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus' song:
 13410	I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her
 13411	door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity
 13412	I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those
 13413	words, Stephen: love's bitter mystery.
 13414	
 13415	Where now?
 13416	
 13417	Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,
 13418	a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny
 13419	window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing in the
 13420	pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:
 13421	
 13422	     _I am the boy
 13423	     That can enjoy
 13424	     Invisibility._
 13425	
 13426	
 13427	Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.
 13428	
 13429	_And no more turn aside and brood._
 13430	
 13431	
 13432	Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his
 13433	brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had
 13434	approached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,
 13435	roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely
 13436	fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children's
 13437	shirts.
 13438	
 13439	In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its
 13440	loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,
 13441	bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.
 13442	
 13443	Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me
 13444	alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured
 13445	face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on
 13446	their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. _Liliata rutilantium te
 13447	confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat._
 13448	
 13449	Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!
 13450	
 13451	No, mother! Let me be and let me live.
 13452	
 13453	--Kinch ahoy!
 13454	
 13455	Buck Mulligan's voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the
 13456	staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul's cry,
 13457	heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.
 13458	
 13459	--Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is
 13460	apologising for waking us last night. It's all right.
 13461	
 13462	--I'm coming, Stephen said, turning.
 13463	
 13464	--Do, for Jesus' sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our
 13465	sakes.
 13466	
 13467	His head disappeared and reappeared.
 13468	
 13469	--I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it's very clever. Touch
 13470	him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.
 13471	
 13472	--I get paid this morning, Stephen said.
 13473	
 13474	--The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.
 13475	
 13476	--If you want it, Stephen said.
 13477	
 13478	--Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We'll
 13479	have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent
 13480	sovereigns.
 13481	
 13482	He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of
 13483	tune with a Cockney accent:
 13484	
 13485	     _O, won't we have a merry time,
 13486	     Drinking whisky, beer and wine!
 13487	     On coronation,
 13488	     Coronation day!
 13489	     O, won't we have a merry time
 13490	     On coronation day!_
 13491	
 13492	
 13493	Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,
 13494	forgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there
 13495	all day, forgotten friendship?
 13496	
 13497	He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
 13498	smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.
 13499	So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and
 13500	yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.
 13501	
 13502	In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan's gowned form
 13503	moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its
 13504	yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
 13505	from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
 13506	coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.
 13507	
 13508	--We'll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?
 13509	
 13510	Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the
 13511	hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open
 13512	the inner doors.
 13513	
 13514	--Have you the key? a voice asked.
 13515	
 13516	--Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I'm choked!
 13517	
 13518	He howled, without looking up from the fire:
 13519	
 13520	--Kinch!
 13521	
 13522	--It's in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.
 13523	
 13524	The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been
 13525	set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the
 13526	doorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and
 13527	sat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside
 13528	him. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set
 13529	them down heavily and sighed with relief.
 13530	
 13531	--I'm melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a
 13532	word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines,
 13533	come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.
 13534	Where's the sugar? O, jay, there's no milk.
 13535	
 13536	Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from
 13537	the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.
 13538	
 13539	--What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.
 13540	
 13541	--We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There's a lemon in the
 13542	locker.
 13543	
 13544	--O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove
 13545	milk.
 13546	
 13547	Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:
 13548	
 13549	--That woman is coming up with the milk.
 13550	
 13551	--The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his
 13552	chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here,
 13553	I can't go fumbling at the damned eggs.
 13554	
 13555	He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three
 13556	plates, saying:
 13557	
 13558	--_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._
 13559	
 13560	Haines sat down to pour out the tea.
 13561	
 13562	--I'm giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do
 13563	make strong tea, don't you?
 13564	
 13565	Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman's
 13566	wheedling voice:
 13567	
 13568	--When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I
 13569	makes water I makes water.
 13570	
 13571	--By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.
 13572	
 13573	Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:
 13574	
 13575	--_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she. _Begob, ma'am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God
 13576	send you don't make them in the one pot._
 13577	
 13578	He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
 13579	on his knife.
 13580	
 13581	--That's folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five
 13582	lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of
 13583	Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.
 13584	
 13585	He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
 13586	brows:
 13587	
 13588	--Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan's tea and water pot spoken
 13589	of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?
 13590	
 13591	--I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.
 13592	
 13593	--Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?
 13594	
 13595	--I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
 13596	Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.
 13597	
 13598	Buck Mulligan's face smiled with delight.
 13599	
 13600	--Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth
 13601	and blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!
 13602	
 13603	Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
 13604	rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:
 13605	
 13606	     _--For old Mary Ann
 13607	     She doesn't care a damn.
 13608	     But, hising up her petticoats..._
 13609	
 13610	
 13611	He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.
 13612	
 13613	The doorway was darkened by an entering form.
 13614	
 13615	--The milk, sir!
 13616	
 13617	--Come in, ma'am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.
 13618	
 13619	An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen's elbow.
 13620	
 13621	--That's a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.
 13622	
 13623	--To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!
 13624	
 13625	Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.
 13626	
 13627	--The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of
 13628	the collector of prepuces.
 13629	
 13630	--How much, sir? asked the old woman.
 13631	
 13632	--A quart, Stephen said.
 13633	
 13634	He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
 13635	milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and
 13636	a tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe
 13637	a messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.
 13638	Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her
 13639	toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed
 13640	about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old
 13641	woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of
 13642	an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common
 13643	cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid,
 13644	whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.
 13645	
 13646	--It is indeed, ma'am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.
 13647	
 13648	--Taste it, sir, she said.
 13649	
 13650	He drank at her bidding.
 13651	
 13652	--If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
 13653	loudly, we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten
 13654	guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with
 13655	dust, horsedung and consumptives' spits.
 13656	
 13657	--Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.
 13658	
 13659	--I am, ma'am, Buck Mulligan answered.
 13660	
 13661	--Look at that now, she said.
 13662	
 13663	Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice
 13664	that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
 13665	slights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there
 13666	is of her but her woman's unclean loins, of man's flesh made not in
 13667	God's likeness, the serpent's prey. And to the loud voice that now bids
 13668	her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.
 13669	
 13670	--Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.
 13671	
 13672	--Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.
 13673	
 13674	Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.
 13675	
 13676	--Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?
 13677	
 13678	--I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the
 13679	west, sir?
 13680	
 13681	--I am an Englishman, Haines answered.
 13682	
 13683	--He's English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak
 13684	Irish in Ireland.
 13685	
 13686	--Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I'm ashamed I don't speak
 13687	the language myself. I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows.
 13688	
 13689	--Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill
 13690	us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma'am?
 13691	
 13692	--No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
 13693	milkcan on her forearm and about to go.
 13694	
 13695	Haines said to her:
 13696	
 13697	--Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we?
 13698	
 13699	Stephen filled again the three cups.
 13700	
 13701	--Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it's seven mornings a pint at
 13702	twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
 13703	mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That's a
 13704	shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.
 13705	
 13706	Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
 13707	buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his
 13708	trouser pockets.
 13709	
 13710	--Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.
 13711	
 13712	Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the
 13713	thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in
 13714	his fingers and cried:
 13715	
 13716	--A miracle!
 13717	
 13718	He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:
 13719	
 13720	--Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.
 13721	
 13722	Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.
 13723	
 13724	--We'll owe twopence, he said.
 13725	
 13726	--Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good
 13727	morning, sir.
 13728	
 13729	She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan's tender chant:
 13730	
 13731	     _--Heart of my heart, were it more,
 13732	     More would be laid at your feet._
 13733	
 13734	
 13735	He turned to Stephen and said:
 13736	
 13737	--Seriously, Dedalus. I'm stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring
 13738	us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland
 13739	expects that every man this day will do his duty.
 13740	
 13741	--That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your
 13742	national library today.
 13743	
 13744	--Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.
 13745	
 13746	He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:
 13747	
 13748	--Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?
 13749	
 13750	Then he said to Haines:
 13751	
 13752	--The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.
 13753	
 13754	--All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey
 13755	trickle over a slice of the loaf.
 13756	
 13757	Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
 13758	loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:
 13759	
 13760	--I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.
 13761	
 13762	Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.
 13763	Conscience. Yet here's a spot.
 13764	
 13765	--That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
 13766	of Irish art is deuced good.
 13767	
 13768	Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen's foot under the table and said with warmth
 13769	of tone:
 13770	
 13771	--Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.
 13772	
 13773	--Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just
 13774	thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.
 13775	
 13776	--Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.
 13777	
 13778	Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of
 13779	the hammock, said:
 13780	
 13781	--I don't know, I'm sure.
 13782	
 13783	He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and
 13784	said with coarse vigour:
 13785	
 13786	--You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?
 13787	
 13788	--Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the
 13789	milkwoman or from him. It's a toss up, I think.
 13790	
 13791	--I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
 13792	with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.
 13793	
 13794	--I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.
 13795	
 13796	Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen's arm.
 13797	
 13798	--From me, Kinch, he said.
 13799	
 13800	In a suddenly changed tone he added:
 13801	
 13802	--To tell you the God's truth I think you're right. Damn all else they
 13803	are good for. Why don't you play them as I do? To hell with them all.
 13804	Let us get out of the kip.
 13805	
 13806	He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
 13807	resignedly:
 13808	
 13809	--Mulligan is stripped of his garments.
 13810	
 13811	He emptied his pockets on to the table.
 13812	
 13813	--There's your snotrag, he said.
 13814	
 13815	And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,
 13816	chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and
 13817	rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,
 13818	we'll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and
 13819	green boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I
 13820	contradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of
 13821	his talking hands.
 13822	
 13823	--And there's your Latin quarter hat, he said.
 13824	
 13825	Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the
 13826	doorway:
 13827	
 13828	--Are you coming, you fellows?
 13829	
 13830	--I'm ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,
 13831	Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out
 13832	with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:
 13833	
 13834	--And going forth he met Butterly.
 13835	
 13836	Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
 13837	and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
 13838	locked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.
 13839	
 13840	At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:
 13841	
 13842	--Did you bring the key?
 13843	
 13844	--I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.
 13845	
 13846	He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy
 13847	bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.
 13848	
 13849	--Down, sir! How dare you, sir!
 13850	
 13851	Haines asked:
 13852	
 13853	--Do you pay rent for this tower?
 13854	
 13855	--Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.
 13856	
 13857	--To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.
 13858	
 13859	They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:
 13860	
 13861	--Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?
 13862	
 13863	--Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on
 13864	the sea. But ours is the _omphalos_.
 13865	
 13866	--What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.
 13867	
 13868	--No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I'm not equal to Thomas Aquinas
 13869	and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I
 13870	have a few pints in me first.
 13871	
 13872	He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
 13873	primrose waistcoat:
 13874	
 13875	--You couldn't manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?
 13876	
 13877	--It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.
 13878	
 13879	--You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?
 13880	
 13881	--Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.
 13882	It's quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet's grandson is
 13883	Shakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
 13884	father.
 13885	
 13886	--What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?
 13887	
 13888	Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
 13889	loose laughter, said to Stephen's ear:
 13890	
 13891	--O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!
 13892	
 13893	--We're always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is
 13894	rather long to tell.
 13895	
 13896	Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.
 13897	
 13898	--The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.
 13899	
 13900	--I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this
 13901	tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. _That beetles
 13902	o'er his base into the sea,_ isn't it?
 13903	
 13904	Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did
 13905	not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in
 13906	cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.
 13907	
 13908	--It's a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.
 13909	
 13910	Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.
 13911	The seas' ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the
 13912	smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail
 13913	tacking by the Muglins.
 13914	
 13915	--I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.
 13916	The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the
 13917	Father.
 13918	
 13919	Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked
 13920	at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
 13921	suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved
 13922	a doll's head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and
 13923	began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:
 13924	
 13925	     _--I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.
 13926	     My mother's a jew, my father's a bird.
 13927	     With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.
 13928	     So here's to disciples and Calvary._
 13929	
 13930	
 13931	He held up a forefinger of warning.
 13932	
 13933	     _--If anyone thinks that I amn't divine
 13934	     He'll get no free drinks when I'm making the wine
 13935	     But have to drink water and wish it were plain
 13936	     That i make when the wine becomes water again._
 13937	
 13938	
 13939	He tugged swiftly at Stephen's ashplant in farewell and, running forward
 13940	to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or
 13941	wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:
 13942	
 13943	     _--Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said
 13944	     And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.
 13945	     What's bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
 13946	     And Olivet's breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!_
 13947	
 13948	
 13949	He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his
 13950	winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury's hat quivering in the fresh
 13951	wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.
 13952	
 13953	Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and
 13954	said:
 13955	
 13956	--We oughtn't to laugh, I suppose. He's rather blasphemous. I'm not a
 13957	believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of
 13958	it somehow, doesn't it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?
 13959	
 13960	--The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.
 13961	
 13962	--O, Haines said, you have heard it before?
 13963	
 13964	--Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.
 13965	
 13966	--You're not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in
 13967	the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a
 13968	personal God.
 13969	
 13970	--There's only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.
 13971	
 13972	Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a
 13973	green stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.
 13974	
 13975	--Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.
 13976	
 13977	Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his
 13978	sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang
 13979	it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk
 13980	towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.
 13981	
 13982	--Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe
 13983	or you don't, isn't it? Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a
 13984	personal God. You don't stand for that, I suppose?
 13985	
 13986	--You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
 13987	example of free thought.
 13988	
 13989	He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his
 13990	side. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.
 13991	My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line
 13992	along the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.
 13993	He wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt
 13994	bread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his
 13995	eyes.
 13996	
 13997	--After all, Haines began...
 13998	
 13999	Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not
 14000	all unkind.
 14001	
 14002	--After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your
 14003	own master, it seems to me.
 14004	
 14005	--I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an
 14006	Italian.
 14007	
 14008	--Italian? Haines said.
 14009	
 14010	A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.
 14011	
 14012	--And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.
 14013	
 14014	--Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?
 14015	
 14016	--The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and
 14017	the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.
 14018	
 14019	Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he
 14020	spoke.
 14021	
 14022	--I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think
 14023	like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather
 14024	unfairly. It seems history is to blame.
 14025	
 14026	The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen's memory the triumph
 14027	of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam
 14028	ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own
 14029	rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the
 14030	mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in
 14031	affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church
 14032	militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies
 14033	fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of
 14034	whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the
 14035	consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning
 14036	Christ's terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who
 14037	held that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken
 14038	a moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void
 14039	awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a
 14040	worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael's host,
 14041	who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their
 14042	shields.
 14043	
 14044	Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. _Zut! Nom de Dieu!_
 14045	
 14046	--Of course I'm a Britisher, Haines's voice said, and I feel as one. I
 14047	don't want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.
 14048	That's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now.
 14049	
 14050	Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.
 14051	
 14052	--She's making for Bullock harbour.
 14053	
 14054	The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.
 14055	
 14056	--There's five fathoms out there, he said. It'll be swept up that way
 14057	when the tide comes in about one. It's nine days today.
 14058	
 14059	The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting
 14060	for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,
 14061	saltwhite. Here I am.
 14062	
 14063	They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on
 14064	a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.
 14065	A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise
 14066	his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.
 14067	
 14068	--Is the brother with you, Malachi?
 14069	
 14070	--Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.
 14071	
 14072	--Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young
 14073	thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.
 14074	
 14075	--Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.
 14076	
 14077	Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near
 14078	the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,
 14079	water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water
 14080	rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
 14081	sagging loincloth.
 14082	
 14083	Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
 14084	and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips
 14085	and breastbone.
 14086	
 14087	--Seymour's back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
 14088	rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.
 14089	
 14090	--Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.
 14091	
 14092	--Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?
 14093	
 14094	--Yes.
 14095	
 14096	--Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with
 14097	money.
 14098	
 14099	--Is she up the pole?
 14100	
 14101	--Better ask Seymour that.
 14102	
 14103	--Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.
 14104	
 14105	He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
 14106	tritely:
 14107	
 14108	--Redheaded women buck like goats.
 14109	
 14110	He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.
 14111	
 14112	--My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I'm the _Uebermensch._ Toothless
 14113	Kinch and I, the supermen.
 14114	
 14115	He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
 14116	clothes lay.
 14117	
 14118	--Are you going in here, Malachi?
 14119	
 14120	--Yes. Make room in the bed.
 14121	
 14122	The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached
 14123	the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a
 14124	stone, smoking.
 14125	
 14126	--Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.
 14127	
 14128	--Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.
 14129	
 14130	Stephen turned away.
 14131	
 14132	--I'm going, Mulligan, he said.
 14133	
 14134	--Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.
 14135	
 14136	Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
 14137	clothes.
 14138	
 14139	--And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.
 14140	
 14141	Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck
 14142	Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:
 14143	
 14144	--He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake
 14145	Zarathustra.
 14146	
 14147	His plump body plunged.
 14148	
 14149	--We'll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the
 14150	path and smiling at wild Irish.
 14151	
 14152	Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.
 14153	
 14154	--The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.
 14155	
 14156	--Good, Stephen said.
 14157	
 14158	He walked along the upwardcurving path.
 14159	
 14160	     _Liliata rutilantium.
 14161	     Turma circumdet.
 14162	     Iubilantium te virginum._
 14163	
 14164	
 14165	The priest's grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will
 14166	not sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.
 14167	
 14168	A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning
 14169	the curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a
 14170	seal's, far out on the water, round.
 14171	
 14172	Usurper.
 14173	
 14174	
 14175	
 14176	--You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?
 14177	
 14178	--Tarentum, sir.
 14179	
 14180	--Very good. Well?
 14181	
 14182	--There was a battle, sir.
 14183	
 14184	--Very good. Where?
 14185	
 14186	The boy's blank face asked the blank window.
 14187	
 14188	Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as
 14189	memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake's wings
 14190	of excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling
 14191	masonry, and time one livid final flame. What's left us then?
 14192	
 14193	--I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.
 14194	
 14195	--Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the
 14196	gorescarred book.
 14197	
 14198	--Yes, sir. And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done
 14199	for._
 14200	
 14201	That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From
 14202	a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,
 14203	leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.
 14204	
 14205	--You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?
 14206	
 14207	--End of Pyrrhus, sir?
 14208	
 14209	--I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.
 14210	
 14211	--Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?
 14212	
 14213	A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong's satchel. He curled them
 14214	between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to
 14215	the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy's breath. Welloff people, proud
 14216	that their eldest son was in the navy. Vico road, Dalkey.
 14217	
 14218	--Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.
 14219	
 14220	All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round
 14221	at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh
 14222	more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.
 14223	
 14224	--Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book,
 14225	what is a pier.
 14226	
 14227	--A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a
 14228	bridge. Kingstown pier, sir.
 14229	
 14230	Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench
 14231	whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.
 14232	All. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their
 14233	likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets
 14234	tittering in the struggle.
 14235	
 14236	--Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.
 14237	
 14238	The words troubled their gaze.
 14239	
 14240	--How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.
 14241	
 14242	For Haines's chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild
 14243	drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A
 14244	jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a
 14245	clement master's praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly
 14246	for the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other
 14247	too often heard, their land a pawnshop.
 14248	
 14249	Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam's hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not
 14250	been knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has
 14251	branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite
 14252	possibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing
 14253	that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass?
 14254	Weave, weaver of the wind.
 14255	
 14256	--Tell us a story, sir.
 14257	
 14258	--O, do, sir. A ghoststory.
 14259	
 14260	--Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.
 14261	
 14262	-_-Weep no more,_ Comyn said.
 14263	
 14264	--Go on then, Talbot.
 14265	
 14266	--And the story, sir?
 14267	
 14268	--After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.
 14269	
 14270	A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork
 14271	of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:
 14272	
 14273	     _--Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more
 14274	     For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,
 14275	     Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._
 14276	
 14277	
 14278	It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.
 14279	Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated
 14280	out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he
 14281	had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow
 14282	a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains
 14283	about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and
 14284	in my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of
 14285	brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of
 14286	thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the
 14287	soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of
 14288	forms.
 14289	
 14290	Talbot repeated:
 14291	
 14292	     _--Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,
 14293	     Through the dear might..._
 14294	
 14295	
 14296	--Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don't see anything.
 14297	
 14298	--What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.
 14299	
 14300	His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having
 14301	just remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these
 14302	craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer's heart and lips and
 14303	on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the
 14304	tribute. To Caesar what is Caesar's, to God what is God's. A long
 14305	look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the
 14306	church's looms. Ay.
 14307	
 14308	     _Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.
 14309	     My father gave me seeds to sow._
 14310	
 14311	
 14312	Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.
 14313	
 14314	--Have I heard all? Stephen asked.
 14315	
 14316	--Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.
 14317	
 14318	--Half day, sir. Thursday.
 14319	
 14320	--Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.
 14321	
 14322	They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.
 14323	Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling
 14324	gaily:
 14325	
 14326	--A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.
 14327	
 14328	--O, ask me, sir.
 14329	
 14330	--A hard one, sir.
 14331	
 14332	--This is the riddle, Stephen said:
 14333	
 14334	     _The cock crew,
 14335	     The sky was blue:
 14336	     The bells in heaven
 14337	     Were striking eleven.
 14338	     'Tis time for this poor soul
 14339	     To go to heaven._
 14340	
 14341	
 14342	What is that?
 14343	
 14344	--What, sir?
 14345	
 14346	--Again, sir. We didn't hear.
 14347	
 14348	Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence
 14349	Cochrane said:
 14350	
 14351	--What is it, sir? We give it up.
 14352	
 14353	Stephen, his throat itching, answered:
 14354	
 14355	--The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.
 14356	
 14357	He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries
 14358	echoed dismay.
 14359	
 14360	A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:
 14361	
 14362	--Hockey!
 14363	
 14364	They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly
 14365	they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and
 14366	clamour of their boots and tongues.
 14367	
 14368	Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
 14369	copybook. His thick hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness
 14370	and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his
 14371	cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent
 14372	and damp as a snail's bed.
 14373	
 14374	He held out his copybook. The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.
 14375	Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with
 14376	blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.
 14377	
 14378	--Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them
 14379	to you, sir.
 14380	
 14381	Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.
 14382	
 14383	--Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.
 14384	
 14385	--Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to
 14386	copy them off the board, sir.
 14387	
 14388	--Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.
 14389	
 14390	--No, sir.
 14391	
 14392	Ugly and futile: lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink, a snail's
 14393	bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.
 14394	But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot,
 14395	a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery blood drained
 14396	from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in life? His
 14397	mother's prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.
 14398	She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire,
 14399	an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being
 14400	trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul
 14401	gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek
 14402	of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth,
 14403	listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.
 14404	
 14405	Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by algebra
 14406	that Shakespeare's ghost is Hamlet's grandfather. Sargent peered askance
 14407	through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the
 14408	hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.
 14409	
 14410	Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of
 14411	their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,
 14412	traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from
 14413	the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement,
 14414	flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a
 14415	darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.
 14416	
 14417	--Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?
 14418	
 14419	--Yes, sir.
 14420	
 14421	In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word
 14422	of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of
 14423	shame flickering behind his dull skin. _Amor matris:_ subjective and
 14424	objective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed
 14425	him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.
 14426	
 14427	Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My
 14428	childhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or
 14429	lightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony
 14430	sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their
 14431	tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.
 14432	
 14433	The sum was done.
 14434	
 14435	--It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.
 14436	
 14437	--Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.
 14438	
 14439	He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
 14440	copybook back to his bench.
 14441	
 14442	--You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said
 14443	as he followed towards the door the boy's graceless form.
 14444	
 14445	--Yes, sir.
 14446	
 14447	In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.
 14448	
 14449	--Sargent!
 14450	
 14451	--Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.
 14452	
 14453	He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
 14454	field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and
 14455	Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When
 14456	he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He
 14457	turned his angry white moustache.
 14458	
 14459	--What is it now? he cried continually without listening.
 14460	
 14461	--Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.
 14462	
 14463	--Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore
 14464	order here.
 14465	
 14466	And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man's voice
 14467	cried sternly:
 14468	
 14469	--What is the matter? What is it now?
 14470	
 14471	Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed
 14472	round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.
 14473	
 14474	Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather
 14475	of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. As it was
 14476	in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins,
 14477	base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their spooncase
 14478	of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the
 14479	gentiles: world without end.
 14480	
 14481	A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his
 14482	rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.
 14483	
 14484	--First, our little financial settlement, he said.
 14485	
 14486	He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It
 14487	slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and
 14488	laid them carefully on the table.
 14489	
 14490	--Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.
 14491	
 14492	And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen's embarrassed hand moved
 14493	over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money
 14494	cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir's turban, and
 14495	this, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim's hoard, dead treasure,
 14496	hollow shells.
 14497	
 14498	A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.
 14499	
 14500	--Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.
 14501	These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is for
 14502	shillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.
 14503	
 14504	He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.
 14505	
 14506	--Three twelve, he said. I think you'll find that's right.
 14507	
 14508	--Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy
 14509	haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.
 14510	
 14511	--No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.
 14512	
 14513	Stephen's hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too
 14514	of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and
 14515	misery.
 14516	
 14517	--Don't carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You'll pull it out somewhere
 14518	and lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You'll find them very
 14519	handy.
 14520	
 14521	Answer something.
 14522	
 14523	--Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.
 14524	
 14525	The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times
 14526	now. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant
 14527	if I will.
 14528	
 14529	--Because you don't save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don't
 14530	know yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as I
 14531	have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say?
 14532	_Put but money in thy purse._
 14533	
 14534	--Iago, Stephen murmured.
 14535	
 14536	He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man's stare.
 14537	
 14538	--He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but
 14539	an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you
 14540	know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman's
 14541	mouth?
 14542	
 14543	The seas' ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems
 14544	history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.
 14545	
 14546	--That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.
 14547	
 14548	--Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That's not English. A French Celt said that. He
 14549	tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.
 14550	
 14551	--I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. _I paid
 14552	my way._
 14553	
 14554	Good man, good man.
 14555	
 14556	_--I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel
 14557	that? _I owe nothing._ Can you?
 14558	
 14559	Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.
 14560	Curran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.
 14561	Temple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob
 14562	Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five
 14563	weeks' board. The lump I have is useless.
 14564	
 14565	--For the moment, no, Stephen answered.
 14566	
 14567	Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.
 14568	
 14569	--I knew you couldn't, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it.
 14570	We are a generous people but we must also be just.
 14571	
 14572	--I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.
 14573	
 14574	Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the
 14575	shapely bulk of a man in tartan filibegs: Albert Edward, prince of
 14576	Wales.
 14577	
 14578	--You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.
 14579	I saw three generations since O'Connell's time. I remember the famine in
 14580	'46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the
 14581	union twenty years before O'Connell did or before the prelates of your
 14582	communion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.
 14583	
 14584	Glorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the
 14585	splendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, the
 14586	planters' covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie
 14587	down.
 14588	
 14589	Stephen sketched a brief gesture.
 14590	
 14591	--I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But
 14592	I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are
 14593	all Irish, all kings' sons.
 14594	
 14595	--Alas, Stephen said.
 14596	
 14597	--_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for
 14598	it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do
 14599	so.
 14600	
 14601	     _Lal the ral the ra
 14602	     The rocky road to Dublin._
 14603	
 14604	
 14605	A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John!
 14606	Soft day, your honour!... Day!... Day!... Two topboots jog dangling
 14607	on to Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.
 14608	
 14609	--That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,
 14610	with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.
 14611	Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.
 14612	
 14613	He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read
 14614	off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.
 14615	
 14616	--Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of
 14617	common sense._ Just a moment.
 14618	
 14619	He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow
 14620	and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,
 14621	sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.
 14622	
 14623	Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed
 14624	around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek
 14625	heads poised in air: lord Hastings' Repulse, the duke of Westminster's
 14626	Shotover, the duke of Beaufort's Ceylon, _prix de Paris_, 1866. Elfin
 14627	riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds, backing king's
 14628	colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.
 14629	
 14630	--Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. But prompt ventilation of this
 14631	allimportant question...
 14632	
 14633	Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the
 14634	mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek
 14635	of the canteen, over the motley slush. Fair Rebel! Fair Rebel! Even
 14636	money the favourite: ten to one the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers
 14637	we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past
 14638	the meatfaced woman, a butcher's dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of
 14639	orange.
 14640	
 14641	Shouts rang shrill from the boys' playfield and a whirring whistle.
 14642	
 14643	Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley,
 14644	the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother's darling who seems
 14645	to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.
 14646	Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain,
 14647	a shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts.
 14648	
 14649	--Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.
 14650	
 14651	He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.
 14652	
 14653	--I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It's about
 14654	the foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two
 14655	opinions on the matter.
 14656	
 14657	May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of _laissez faire_
 14658	which so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old
 14659	industries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.
 14660	European conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of
 14661	the channel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of
 14662	agriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who
 14663	was no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.
 14664	
 14665	--I don't mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.
 14666	
 14667	Foot and mouth disease. Known as Koch's preparation. Serum and virus.
 14668	Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor's horses at Murzsteg,
 14669	lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous
 14670	offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant question. In
 14671	every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking you for the
 14672	hospitality of your columns.
 14673	
 14674	--I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the
 14675	next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can
 14676	be cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is
 14677	regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They
 14678	offer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with
 14679	the department. Now I'm going to try publicity. I am surrounded by
 14680	difficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by...
 14681	
 14682	He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.
 14683	
 14684	--Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the
 14685	jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are
 14686	the signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the
 14687	nation's vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure
 14688	as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of
 14689	destruction. Old England is dying.
 14690	
 14691	He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a
 14692	broad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.
 14693	
 14694	--Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.
 14695	
 14696	     _The harlot's cry from street to street
 14697	     Shall weave old England's windingsheet._
 14698	
 14699	
 14700	His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which
 14701	he halted.
 14702	
 14703	--A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or
 14704	gentile, is he not?
 14705	
 14706	--They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see
 14707	the darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the
 14708	earth to this day.
 14709	
 14710	On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
 14711	prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,
 14712	uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk
 14713	hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full
 14714	slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but
 14715	knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain
 14716	patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard
 14717	heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their
 14718	years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.
 14719	
 14720	--Who has not? Stephen said.
 14721	
 14722	--What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.
 14723	
 14724	He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell
 14725	sideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.
 14726	
 14727	--History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.
 14728	
 14729	From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.
 14730	What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?
 14731	
 14732	--The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human
 14733	history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.
 14734	
 14735	Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:
 14736	
 14737	--That is God.
 14738	
 14739	Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!
 14740	
 14741	--What? Mr Deasy asked.
 14742	
 14743	--A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.
 14744	
 14745	Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked
 14746	between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.
 14747	
 14748	--I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and
 14749	many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no
 14750	better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten
 14751	years the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the
 14752	strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough's wife and her leman, O'Rourke,
 14753	prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many
 14754	failures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my
 14755	days. But I will fight for the right till the end.
 14756	
 14757	     _For Ulster will fight
 14758	     And Ulster will be right._
 14759	
 14760	
 14761	Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.
 14762	
 14763	--Well, sir, he began...
 14764	
 14765	--I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long
 14766	at this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am
 14767	wrong.
 14768	
 14769	--A learner rather, Stephen said.
 14770	
 14771	And here what will you learn more?
 14772	
 14773	Mr Deasy shook his head.
 14774	
 14775	--Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great
 14776	teacher.
 14777	
 14778	Stephen rustled the sheets again.
 14779	
 14780	--As regards these, he began.
 14781	
 14782	--Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them
 14783	published at once.
 14784	
 14785	_ Telegraph. Irish Homestead._
 14786	
 14787	--I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two
 14788	editors slightly.
 14789	
 14790	--That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,
 14791	M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the
 14792	City Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You
 14793	see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?
 14794	
 14795	_--The Evening Telegraph..._
 14796	
 14797	--That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to
 14798	answer that letter from my cousin.
 14799	
 14800	--Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.
 14801	Thank you.
 14802	
 14803	--Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I
 14804	like to break a lance with you, old as I am.
 14805	
 14806	--Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.
 14807	
 14808	He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,
 14809	hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.
 14810	The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:
 14811	toothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will dub
 14812	me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.
 14813	
 14814	--Mr Dedalus!
 14815	
 14816	Running after me. No more letters, I hope.
 14817	
 14818	--Just one moment.
 14819	
 14820	--Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.
 14821	
 14822	Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.
 14823	
 14824	--I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of
 14825	being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know
 14826	that? No. And do you know why?
 14827	
 14828	He frowned sternly on the bright air.
 14829	
 14830	--Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.
 14831	
 14832	--Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.
 14833	
 14834	A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
 14835	rattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,
 14836	his lifted arms waving to the air.
 14837	
 14838	--She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
 14839	stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That's why.
 14840	
 14841	On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
 14842	spangles, dancing coins.
 14843	
 14844	
 14845	Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought
 14846	through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn
 14847	and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver,
 14848	rust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies.
 14849	Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By
 14850	knocking his sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a
 14851	millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_. Limit of the diaphane in. Why
 14852	in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it it
 14853	is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.
 14854	
 14855	
 14856	Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and
 14857	shells. You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a time.
 14858	A very short space of time through very short times of space. Five, six:
 14859	the _nacheinander_. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the
 14860	audible. Open your eyes. No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles
 14861	o'er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am
 14862	getting on nicely in the dark. My ash sword hangs at my side. Tap with
 14863	it: they do. My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs,
 14864	_nebeneinander_. Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los Demiurgos_.
 14865	Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand? Crush, crack, crick,
 14866	crick. Wild sea money. Dominie Deasy kens them a'. Won't you come to
 14867	Sandymount, Madeline the mare?
 14868	
 14869	
 14870	Rhythm begins, you see. I hear. Acatalectic tetrameter of iambs
 14871	marching. No, agallop: _deline the mare_.
 14872	
 14873	Open your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I
 14874	open and am for ever in the black adiaphane. _Basta_! I will see if I
 14875	can see.
 14876	
 14877	See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world
 14878	without end.
 14879	
 14880	They came down the steps from Leahy's terrace prudently, _Frauenzimmer_:
 14881	and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in
 14882	the silted sand. Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.
 14883	Number one swung lourdily her midwife's bag, the other's gamp poked in
 14884	the beach. From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs Florence MacCabe,
 14885	relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street. One
 14886	of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life. Creation from nothing.
 14887	What has she in the bag? A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed
 14888	in ruddy wool. The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of
 14889	all flesh. That is why mystic monks. Will you be as gods? Gaze in your
 14890	omphalos. Hello! Kinch here. Put me on to Edenville. Aleph, alpha:
 14891	nought, nought, one.
 14892	
 14893	Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. She had no navel.
 14894	Gaze. Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum,
 14895	no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to
 14896	everlasting. Womb of sin.
 14897	
 14898	Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. By them, the man
 14899	with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.
 14900	They clasped and sundered, did the coupler's will. From before the ages
 14901	He willed me and now may not will me away or ever. A _lex eterna_ stays
 14902	about Him. Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are
 14903	consubstantial? Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions? Warring
 14904	his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality. Illstarred
 14905	heresiarch' In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: euthanasia.
 14906	With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of
 14907	a widowed see, with upstiffed omophorion, with clotted hinderparts.
 14908	
 14909	Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs. They are coming, waves.
 14910	The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of
 14911	Mananaan.
 14912	
 14913	I mustn't forget his letter for the press. And after? The Ship, half
 14914	twelve. By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.
 14915	
 14916	Yes, I must.
 14917	
 14918	His pace slackened. Here. Am I going to aunt Sara's or not? My
 14919	consubstantial father's voice. Did you see anything of your artist
 14920	brother Stephen lately? No? Sure he's not down in Strasburg terrace with
 14921	his aunt Sally? Couldn't he fly a bit higher than that, eh? And and and
 14922	and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si? O, weeping God, the things I
 14923	married into! De boys up in de hayloft. The drunken little costdrawer
 14924	and his brother, the cornet player. Highly respectable gondoliers! And
 14925	skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir. Yes, sir. No, sir.
 14926	Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ!
 14927	
 14928	I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. They take
 14929	me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.
 14930	
 14931	--It's Stephen, sir.
 14932	
 14933	--Let him in. Let Stephen in.
 14934	
 14935	A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.
 14936	
 14937	--We thought you were someone else.
 14938	
 14939	In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the
 14940	hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm. Cleanchested. He has washed the
 14941	upper moiety.
 14942	
 14943	--Morrow, nephew.
 14944	
 14945	He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for
 14946	the eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and
 14947	common searches and a writ of _Duces Tecum_. A bogoak frame over his
 14948	bald head: Wilde's _Requiescat_. The drone of his misleading whistle
 14949	brings Walter back.
 14950	
 14951	--Yes, sir?
 14952	
 14953	--Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Where is she?
 14954	
 14955	--Bathing Crissie, sir.
 14956	
 14957	Papa's little bedpal. Lump of love.
 14958	
 14959	--No, uncle Richie...
 14960	
 14961	--Call me Richie. Damn your lithia water. It lowers. Whusky!
 14962	
 14963	--Uncle Richie, really...
 14964	
 14965	--Sit down or by the law Harry I'll knock you down.
 14966	
 14967	Walter squints vainly for a chair.
 14968	
 14969	--He has nothing to sit down on, sir.
 14970	
 14971	--He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring in our chippendale chair.
 14972	Would you like a bite of something? None of your damned lawdeedaw airs
 14973	here. The rich of a rasher fried with a herring? Sure? So much the
 14974	better. We have nothing in the house but backache pills.
 14975	
 14976	_All'erta_!
 14977	
 14978	He drones bars of Ferrando's _aria di sortita_. The grandest number,
 14979	Stephen, in the whole opera. Listen.
 14980	
 14981	His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air,
 14982	his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.
 14983	
 14984	This wind is sweeter.
 14985	
 14986	Houses of decay, mine, his and all. You told the Clongowes gentry you
 14987	had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. Come out of
 14988	them, Stephen. Beauty is not there. Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh's
 14989	library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. For whom?
 14990	The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close. A hater of his kind
 14991	ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon,
 14992	his eyeballs stars. Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled. The oval equine
 14993	faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws. Abbas
 14994	father,--furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains? Paff!
 14995	_Descende, calve, ut ne amplius decalveris_. A garland of grey hair
 14996	on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace
 14997	(_descende_!), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed. Get down, baldpoll!
 14998	A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar's horns,
 14999	the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured
 15000	and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.
 15001	
 15002	And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating
 15003	it. Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.
 15004	Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own
 15005	cheek. Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back. Dan Occam thought of that,
 15006	invincible doctor. A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled
 15007	his brain. Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his
 15008	second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and,
 15009	rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang
 15010	in diphthong.
 15011	
 15012	Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were
 15013	awfully holy, weren't you? You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you
 15014	might not have a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue
 15015	that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the
 15016	wet street. _O si, certo_! Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned
 15017	round a squaw. More tell me, more still!! On the top of the Howth tram
 15018	alone crying to the rain: Naked women! _naked women_! What about that,
 15019	eh?
 15020	
 15021	What about what? What else were they invented for?
 15022	
 15023	Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? I was young.
 15024	You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause
 15025	earnestly, striking face. Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one
 15026	saw: tell no-one. Books you were going to write with letters for titles.
 15027	Have you read his F? O yes, but I prefer Q. Yes, but W is wonderful. O
 15028	yes, W. Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply
 15029	deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the
 15030	world, including Alexandria? Someone was to read them there after a few
 15031	thousand years, a mahamanvantara. Pico della Mirandola like. Ay, very
 15032	like a whale. When one reads these strange pages of one long gone one
 15033	feels that one is at one with one who once...
 15034	
 15035	The grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod again
 15036	a damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the
 15037	unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada.
 15038	Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing
 15039	upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a
 15040	midden of man's ashes. He coasted them, walking warily. A porterbottle
 15041	stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough. A sentinel:
 15042	isle of dreadful thirst. Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze
 15043	of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the
 15044	higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts. Ringsend: wigwams
 15045	of brown steersmen and master mariners. Human shells.
 15046	
 15047	He halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara's. Am I not going there?
 15048	Seems not. No-one about. He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand
 15049	towards the Pigeonhouse.
 15050	
 15051	_--Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?_
 15052	
 15053	_--c'est le pigeon, Joseph._
 15054	
 15055	Patrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar MacMahon.
 15056	Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris. My father's a bird, he
 15057	lapped the sweet _lait chaud_ with pink young tongue, plump bunny's
 15058	face. Lap, _lapin._ He hopes to win in the _gros lots_. About the nature
 15059	of women he read in Michelet. But he must send me _La Vie de Jesus_ by
 15060	M. Leo Taxil. Lent it to his friend.
 15061	
 15062	_--C'est tordant, vous savez. Moi, je suis socialiste. Je ne crois pas
 15063	en l'existence de Dieu. Faut pas le dire a mon p-re._
 15064	
 15065	_--Il croit?_
 15066	
 15067	_--Mon pere, oui._
 15068	
 15069	_Schluss_. He laps.
 15070	
 15071	My Latin quarter hat. God, we simply must dress the character. I want
 15072	puce gloves. You were a student, weren't you? Of what in the other
 15073	devil's name? Paysayenn. P. C. N., you know: _physiques, chimiques et
 15074	naturelles_. Aha. Eating your groatsworth of _mou en civet_, fleshpots
 15075	of Egypt, elbowed by belching cabmen. Just say in the most natural
 15076	tone: when I was in Paris; _boul' Mich'_, I used to. Yes, used to
 15077	carry punched tickets to prove an alibi if they arrested you for murder
 15078	somewhere. Justice. On the night of the seventeenth of February 1904 the
 15079	prisoner was seen by two witnesses. Other fellow did it: other me.
 15080	Hat, tie, overcoat, nose. _Lui, c'est moi_. You seem to have enjoyed
 15081	yourself.
 15082	
 15083	Proudly walking. Whom were you trying to walk like? Forget: a
 15084	dispossessed. With mother's money order, eight shillings, the banging
 15085	door of the post office slammed in your face by the usher. Hunger
 15086	toothache. _Encore deux minutes_. Look clock. Must get. _Ferme_. Hired
 15087	dog! Shoot him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered
 15088	walls all brass buttons. Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack back. Not
 15089	hurt? O, that's all right. Shake hands. See what I meant, see? O, that's
 15090	all right. Shake a shake. O, that's all only all right.
 15091	
 15092	You were going to do wonders, what? Missionary to Europe after fiery
 15093	Columbanus. Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt from
 15094	their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: _Euge! Euge_! Pretending to speak
 15095	broken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence, across
 15096	the slimy pier at Newhaven. _Comment?_ Rich booty you brought back; _Le
 15097	Tutu_, five tattered numbers of _Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge_; a
 15098	blue French telegram, curiosity to show:
 15099	
 15100	--Mother dying come home father.
 15101	
 15102	The aunt thinks you killed your mother. That's why she won't.
 15103	
 15104	     _Then here's a health to Mulligan's aunt
 15105	     And I'll tell you the reason why.
 15106	     She always kept things decent in
 15107	     The Hannigan famileye._
 15108	
 15109	
 15110	His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by
 15111	the boulders of the south wall. He stared at them proudly, piled stone
 15112	mammoth skulls. Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders. The sun is
 15113	there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.
 15114	
 15115	Paris rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith of
 15116	farls of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court
 15117	the air. Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife's lover's wife, the
 15118	kerchiefed housewife is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand. In
 15119	Rodot's Yvonne and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties, shattering
 15120	with gold teeth _chaussons_ of pastry, their mouths yellowed with the
 15121	_pus_ of _flan breton_. Faces of Paris men go by, their wellpleased
 15122	pleasers, curled conquistadores.
 15123	
 15124	Noon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers
 15125	smeared with printer's ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his
 15126	white. About us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets. _Un demi
 15127	setier!_ A jet of coffee steam from the burnished caldron. She serves me
 15128	at his beck. _Il est irlandais. Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux irlandais,
 15129	nous, Irlande, vous savez ah, oui!_ She thought you wanted a cheese
 15130	_hollandais_. Your postprandial, do you know that word? Postprandial.
 15131	There was a fellow I knew once in Barcelona, queer fellow, used to call
 15132	it his postprandial. Well: _slainte_! Around the slabbed tables the
 15133	tangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges. His breath hangs over our
 15134	saucestained plates, the green fairy's fang thrusting between his lips.
 15135	Of Ireland, the Dalcassians, of hopes, conspiracies, of Arthur Griffith
 15136	now, A E, pimander, good shepherd of men. To yoke me as his yokefellow,
 15137	our crimes our common cause. You're your father's son. I know the voice.
 15138	His fustian shirt, sanguineflowered, trembles its Spanish tassels at
 15139	his secrets. M. Drumont, famous journalist, Drumont, know what he called
 15140	queen Victoria? Old hag with the yellow teeth. _Vieille ogresse_
 15141	with the _dents jaunes_. Maud Gonne, beautiful woman, _La Patrie_, M.
 15142	Millevoye, Felix Faure, know how he died? Licentious men. The froeken,
 15143	_bonne a tout faire_, who rubs male nakedness in the bath at Upsala.
 15144	_Moi faire_, she said, _Tous les messieurs_. Not this _Monsieur_, I
 15145	said. Most licentious custom. Bath a most private thing. I wouldn't let
 15146	my brother, not even my own brother, most lascivious thing. Green eyes,
 15147	I see you. Fang, I feel. Lascivious people.
 15148	
 15149	The blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear. Loose
 15150	tobaccoshreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Raw
 15151	facebones under his peep of day boy's hat. How the head centre got away,
 15152	authentic version. Got up as a young bride, man, veil, orangeblossoms,
 15153	drove out the road to Malahide. Did, faith. Of lost leaders, the
 15154	betrayed, wild escapes. Disguises, clutched at, gone, not here.
 15155	
 15156	Spurned lover. I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell you.
 15157	I'll show you my likeness one day. I was, faith. Lover, for her love he
 15158	prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under the walls
 15159	of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward
 15160	in the fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. In gay Paree he hides,
 15161	Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me. Making his day's stations,
 15162	the dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the Montmartre lair he sleeps
 15163	short night in, rue de la Goutte-d'Or, damascened with flyblown faces of
 15164	the gone. Loveless, landless, wifeless. She is quite nicey comfy
 15165	without her outcast man, madame in rue Git-le-Coeur, canary and two
 15166	buck lodgers. Peachy cheeks, a zebra skirt, frisky as a young thing's.
 15167	Spurned and undespairing. Tell Pat you saw me, won't you? I wanted to
 15168	get poor Pat a job one time. _Mon fils_, soldier of France. I taught him
 15169	to sing _The boys of Kilkenny are stout roaring blades_. Know that old
 15170	lay? I taught Patrice that. Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow's
 15171	castle on the Nore. Goes like this. O, O. He takes me, Napper Tandy, by
 15172	the hand.
 15173	
 15174	     _O, O THE BOYS OF
 15175	     KILKENNY..._
 15176	
 15177	
 15178	Weak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them.
 15179	Remembering thee, O Sion.
 15180	
 15181	He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.
 15182	The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of
 15183	seeds of brightness. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship,
 15184	am I? He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the
 15185	quaking soil. Turn back.
 15186	
 15187	Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly
 15188	in new sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the
 15189	barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my
 15190	feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor. Blue dusk,
 15191	nightfall, deep blue night. In the darkness of the dome they wait,
 15192	their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned
 15193	platters. Who to clear it? He has the key. I will not sleep there when
 15194	this night comes. A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their--blind
 15195	bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted his
 15196	feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Take
 15197	all, keep all. My soul walks with me, form of forms. So in the moon's
 15198	midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing
 15199	Elsinore's tempting flood.
 15200	
 15201	The flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back
 15202	then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. He climbed over the sedge
 15203	and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a
 15204	grike.
 15205	
 15206	A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. Before him the
 15207	gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. _Un coche ensablÃ©_ Louis Veuillot
 15208	called Gautier's prose. These heavy sands are language tide and wind
 15209	have silted here. And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren
 15210	of weasel rats. Hide gold there. Try it. You have some. Sands and
 15211	stones. Heavy of the past. Sir Lout's toys. Mind you don't get one
 15212	bang on the ear. I'm the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well
 15213	boulders, bones for my steppingstones. Feefawfum. I zmellz de bloodz odz
 15214	an Iridzman.
 15215	
 15216	A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.
 15217	Lord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not
 15218	be master of others or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From
 15219	farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures,
 15220	two. The two maries. They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.
 15221	Peekaboo. I see you. No, the dog. He is running back to them. Who?
 15222	
 15223	Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their
 15224	bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings,
 15225	torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the
 15226	collar of gold. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon,
 15227	spouting, hobbling in the shallows. Then from the starving cagework city
 15228	a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers' knives, running,
 15229	scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague and
 15230	slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved among
 15231	them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering
 15232	resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.
 15233	
 15234	The dog's bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy. I
 15235	just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. _Terribilia meditans_. A
 15236	primrose doublet, fortune's knave, smiled on my fear. For that are you
 15237	pining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. The
 15238	Bruce's brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck,
 15239	York's false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of
 15240	a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion
 15241	crowned. All kings' sons. Paradise of pretenders then and now. He saved
 15242	men from drowning and you shake at a cur's yelping. But the courtiers
 15243	who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house. House of...
 15244	We don't want any of your medieval abstrusiosities. Would you do what he
 15245	did? A boat would be near, a lifebuoy. _NatÃ¼rlich_, put there for you.
 15246	Would you or would you not? The man that was drowned nine days ago off
 15247	Maiden's rock. They are waiting for him now. The truth, spit it out. I
 15248	would want to. I would try. I am not a strong swimmer. Water cold soft.
 15249	When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes. Can't see! Who's
 15250	behind me? Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in
 15251	on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured? If
 15252	I had land under my feet. I want his life still to be his, mine to be
 15253	mine. A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his
 15254	death. I... With him together down... I could not save her. Waters:
 15255	bitter death: lost.
 15256	
 15257	A woman and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.
 15258	
 15259	Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on
 15260	all sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made
 15261	off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a
 15262	lowskimming gull. The man's shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He
 15263	turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a
 15264	field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired. At the lacefringe of
 15265	the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His
 15266	snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse. They serpented
 15267	towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking,
 15268	plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.
 15269	
 15270	Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping,
 15271	soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped
 15272	running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again
 15273	reared up at them with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them as
 15274	they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf's tongue redpanting from
 15275	his jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a
 15276	calf's gallop. The carcass lay on his path. He stopped, sniffed, stalked
 15277	round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like
 15278	a dog all over the dead dog's bedraggled fell. Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes
 15279	on the ground, moves to one great goal. Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies
 15280	poor dogsbody's body.
 15281	
 15282	--Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!
 15283	
 15284	The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless
 15285	kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He
 15286	slunk back in a curve. Doesn't see me. Along by the edge of the mole he
 15287	lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed
 15288	against it. He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed
 15289	quick short at an unsmelt rock. The simple pleasures of the poor. His
 15290	hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.
 15291	Something he buried there, his grandmother. He rooted in the sand,
 15292	dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand
 15293	again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in
 15294	spousebreach, vulturing the dead.
 15295	
 15296	After he woke me last night same dream or was it? Wait. Open hallway.
 15297	Street of harlots. Remember. Haroun al Raschid. I am almosting it. That
 15298	man led me, spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held against my
 15299	face. Smiled: creamfruit smell. That was the rule, said. In. Come. Red
 15300	carpet spread. You will see who.
 15301	
 15302	Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians. His blued feet
 15303	out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler
 15304	strangling his unshaven neck. With woman steps she followed: the
 15305	ruffian and his strolling mort. Spoils slung at her back. Loose sand and
 15306	shellgrit crusted her bare feet. About her windraw face hair trailed.
 15307	Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville. When night hides
 15308	her body's flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway
 15309	where dogs have mired. Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in
 15310	O'Loughlin's of Blackpitts. Buss her, wap in rogues' rum lingo, for, O,
 15311	my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend's whiteness under her rancid rags.
 15312	Fumbally's lane that night: the tanyard smells.
 15313	
 15314	     _White thy fambles, red thy gan
 15315	     And thy quarrons dainty is.
 15316	     Couch a hogshead with me then.
 15317	     In the darkmans clip and kiss._
 15318	
 15319	
 15320	Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.
 15321	Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted. Call away let him: _thy quarrons
 15322	dainty is_. Language no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads jabber
 15323	on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.
 15324	
 15325	Passing now.
 15326	
 15327	A side eye at my Hamlet hat. If I were suddenly naked here as I sit? I
 15328	am not. Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun's flaming
 15329	sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges, schlepps,
 15330	trains, drags, trascines her load. A tide westering, moondrawn, in
 15331	her wake. Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, _oinopa
 15332	ponton_, a winedark sea. Behold the handmaid of the moon. In sleep
 15333	the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise. Bridebed, childbed, bed of
 15334	death, ghostcandled. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_. He comes, pale vampire,
 15335	through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her
 15336	mouth's kiss.
 15337	
 15338	Here. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss.
 15339	
 15340	No. Must be two of em. Glue em well. Mouth to her mouth's kiss.
 15341	
 15342	His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.
 15343	Oomb, allwombing tomb. His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched:
 15344	ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring
 15345	wayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy's
 15346	letter. Here. Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.
 15347	Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and
 15348	scribbled words. That's twice I forgot to take slips from the library
 15349	counter.
 15350	
 15351	His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till
 15352	the farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness
 15353	shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there
 15354	with his augur's rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid
 15355	sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.
 15356	I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.
 15357	Endless, would it be mine, form of my form? Who watches me here? Who
 15358	ever anywhere will read these written words? Signs on a white field.
 15359	Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice. The good bishop of Cloyne
 15360	took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with
 15361	coloured emblems hatched on its field. Hold hard. Coloured on a flat:
 15362	yes, that's right. Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat
 15363	I see, east, back. Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in
 15364	stereoscope. Click does the trick. You find my words dark. Darkness is
 15365	in our souls do you not think? Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our
 15366	sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the
 15367	more.
 15368	
 15369	She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue
 15370	hell am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality of
 15371	the ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at Hodges
 15372	Figgis' window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you
 15373	were going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through the
 15374	braided jesse of her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park with a grief
 15375	and kickshaws, a lady of letters. Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a
 15376	pickmeup. Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and
 15377	yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool. Talk about apple dumplings,
 15378	_piuttosto_. Where are your wits?
 15379	
 15380	Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me
 15381	soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone.
 15382	Sad too. Touch, touch me.
 15383	
 15384	He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled
 15385	note and pencil into a pock his hat. His hat down on his eyes. That is
 15386	Kevin Egan's movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep. _Et
 15387	vidit Deus. Et erant valde bona_. Alo! _Bonjour_. Welcome as the flowers
 15388	in May. Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the
 15389	southing sun. I am caught in this burning scene. Pan's hour, the faunal
 15390	noon. Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the
 15391	tawny waters leaves lie wide. Pain is far.
 15392	
 15393	     _And no more turn aside and brood._
 15394	
 15395	His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck's castoffs,
 15396	_nebeneinander_. He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein
 15397	another's foot had nested warm. The foot that beat the ground in
 15398	tripudium, foot I dislove. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt's
 15399	shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris. _Tiens, quel petit pied!_
 15400	Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde's love that dare not speak its
 15401	name. His arm: Cranly's arm. He now will leave me. And the blame? As I
 15402	am. As I am. All or not at all.
 15403	
 15404	In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering
 15405	greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float
 15406	away. I shall wait. No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the
 15407	low rocks, swirling, passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a
 15408	fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of
 15409	waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it slops:
 15410	flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech ceases. It
 15411	flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.
 15412	
 15413	Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and
 15414	sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water
 15415	swaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night:
 15416	lifted, flooded and let fall. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to,
 15417	they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting,
 15418	awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias
 15419	patiens ingemiscit_. To no end gathered; vainly then released,
 15420	forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of
 15421	lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a
 15422	toil of waters.
 15423	
 15424	Five fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one, he
 15425	said. Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a loose
 15426	drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse rising
 15427	saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.
 15428	There he is. Hook it quick. Pull. Sunk though he be beneath the watery
 15429	floor. We have him. Easy now.
 15430	
 15431	Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a
 15432	spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.
 15433	God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed
 15434	mountain. Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a
 15435	urinous offal from all dead. Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes
 15436	upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to
 15437	the sun.
 15438	
 15439	A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths
 15440	known to man. Old Father Ocean. _Prix de paris_: beware of imitations.
 15441	Just you give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.
 15442	
 15443	Come. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there?
 15444	Thunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect,
 15445	_Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_. No. My cockle hat and staff and
 15446	hismy sandal shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.
 15447	
 15448	He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying
 15449	still. Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make
 15450	their end. By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest
 15451	day. Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn
 15452	Tennyson, gentleman poet. _GiÃ _. For the old hag with the yellow teeth.
 15453	And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist. _GiÃ _. My teeth are very
 15454	bad. Why, I wonder. Feel. That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to a
 15455	dentist, I wonder, with that money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch, the
 15456	superman. Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?
 15457	
 15458	My handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?
 15459	
 15460	His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn't. Better buy one.
 15461	
 15462	He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,
 15463	carefully. For the rest let look who will.
 15464	
 15465	Behind. Perhaps there is someone.
 15466	
 15467	He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the
 15468	air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees,
 15469	homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship. +

 15472	
 15473	
 15474	-- II --
 15475	
 15476	Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.
 15477	He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
 15478	liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes. Most of all
 15479	he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of
 15480	faintly scented urine.
 15481	
 15482	Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting
 15483	her breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the
 15484	kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel
 15485	a bit peckish.
 15486	
 15487	The coals were reddening.
 15488	
 15489	Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn't like
 15490	her plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off
 15491	the hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat,
 15492	its spout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked
 15493	stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.
 15494	
 15495	--Mkgnao!
 15496	
 15497	--O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.
 15498	
 15499	The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the
 15500	table, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch my
 15501	head. Prr.
 15502	
 15503	Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see:
 15504	the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her
 15505	tail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his
 15506	knees.
 15507	
 15508	--Milk for the pussens, he said.
 15509	
 15510	--Mrkgnao! the cat cried.
 15511	
 15512	They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we
 15513	understand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too.
 15514	Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder
 15515	what I look like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.
 15516	
 15517	--Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the
 15518	chookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.
 15519	
 15520	Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it.
 15521	
 15522	--Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.
 15523	
 15524	She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively
 15525	and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits
 15526	narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to
 15527	the dresser, took the jug Hanlon's milkman had just filled for him,
 15528	poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.
 15529	
 15530	--Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.
 15531	
 15532	He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped
 15533	three times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they
 15534	can't mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or
 15535	kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.
 15536	
 15537	He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with this
 15538	drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for a
 15539	mutton kidney at Buckley's. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Better
 15540	a pork kidney at Dlugacz's. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped
 15541	slower, then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough?
 15542	To lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round
 15543	him. No.
 15544	
 15545	On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by
 15546	the bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter
 15547	she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.
 15548	
 15549	He said softly in the bare hall:
 15550	
 15551	--I'm going round the corner. Be back in a minute.
 15552	
 15553	And when he had heard his voice say it he added:
 15554	
 15555	--You don't want anything for breakfast?
 15556	
 15557	A sleepy soft grunt answered:
 15558	
 15559	--Mn.
 15560	
 15561	No. She didn't want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,
 15562	as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.
 15563	Must get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.
 15564	Forgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for
 15565	it. Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governor's auction.
 15566	Got a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At
 15567	Plevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I'm proud of it.
 15568	Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was
 15569	farseeing.
 15570	
 15571	His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat
 15572	and his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback
 15573	pictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.
 15574	The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto's
 15575	high grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White slip
 15576	of paper. Quite safe.
 15577	
 15578	On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there.
 15579	In the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky wardrobe.
 15580	No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He pulled
 15581	the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped
 15582	gently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I
 15583	come back anyhow.
 15584	
 15585	He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number
 15586	seventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George's church. Be a
 15587	warm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black
 15588	conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn't go in
 15589	that light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as
 15590	he walked in happy warmth. Boland's breadvan delivering with trays our
 15591	daily but she prefers yesterday's loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.
 15592	Makes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at
 15593	dawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day's march on him. Keep
 15594	it up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a strand,
 15595	strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old
 15596	Tweedy's big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear. Wander
 15597	through awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of carpet
 15598	shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled
 15599	pipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel,
 15600	sherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two. Well,
 15601	meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among the
 15602	pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal,
 15603	the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from
 15604	her doorway. She calls her children home in their dark language. High
 15605	wall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly's
 15606	new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of those instruments
 15607	what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.
 15608	
 15609	Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track
 15610	of the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. What
 15611	Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a
 15612	homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank
 15613	of Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule
 15614	sun rising up in the north-west.
 15615	
 15616	He approached Larry O'Rourke's. From the cellar grating floated up the
 15617	flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out
 15618	whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the
 15619	end of the city traffic. For instance M'Auley's down there: n. g. as
 15620	position. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from
 15621	the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.
 15622	
 15623	Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an
 15624	ad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my
 15625	bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching
 15626	the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him
 15627	off to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I'm going to
 15628	tell you? What's that, Mr O'Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians,
 15629	they'd only be an eight o'clock breakfast for the Japanese.
 15630	
 15631	Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor
 15632	Dignam, Mr O'Rourke.
 15633	
 15634	Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the
 15635	doorway:
 15636	
 15637	--Good day, Mr O'Rourke.
 15638	
 15639	--Good day to you.
 15640	
 15641	--Lovely weather, sir.
 15642	
 15643	--'Tis all that.
 15644	
 15645	Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the county
 15646	Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and behold,
 15647	they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then thin of the
 15648	competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without
 15649	passing a pub. Save it they can't. Off the drunks perhaps. Put down
 15650	three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and
 15651	drabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the
 15652	town travellers. Square it you with the boss and we'll split the job,
 15653	see?
 15654	
 15655	How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels
 15656	of stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint
 15657	Joseph's National school. Brats' clamour. Windows open. Fresh air
 15658	helps memory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee
 15659	doubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At
 15660	their joggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.
 15661	
 15662	He halted before Dlugacz's window, staring at the hanks of sausages,
 15663	polonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened
 15664	in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links,
 15665	packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the
 15666	lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs' blood.
 15667	
 15668	A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He
 15669	stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling
 15670	the items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a pound and
 15671	a half of Denny's sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.
 15672	Woods his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New blood.
 15673	No followers allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the
 15674	clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt
 15675	swings at each whack.
 15676	
 15677	The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with
 15678	blotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.
 15679	
 15680	He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at
 15681	Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter
 15682	sanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round
 15683	it, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting:
 15684	read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page
 15685	rustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the
 15686	beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the
 15687	breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm
 15688	on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled switches in
 15689	their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and
 15690	his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging,
 15691	whack by whack by whack.
 15692	
 15693	The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime
 15694	sausages and made a red grimace.
 15695	
 15696	--Now, my miss, he said.
 15697	
 15698	She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.
 15699	
 15700	--Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,
 15701	please?
 15702	
 15703	Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went
 15704	slowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the
 15705	morning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood
 15706	outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He
 15707	sighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted
 15708	toenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.
 15709	The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For
 15710	another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles lane. They like
 15711	them sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the
 15712	wood.
 15713	
 15714	--Threepence, please.
 15715	
 15716	His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.
 15717	Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid them
 15718	on the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,
 15719	disc by disc, into the till.
 15720	
 15721	--Thank you, sir. Another time.
 15722	
 15723	A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze
 15724	after an instant. No: better not: another time.
 15725	
 15726	--Good morning, he said, moving away.
 15727	
 15728	--Good morning, sir.
 15729	
 15730	No sign. Gone. What matter?
 15731	
 15732	He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:
 15733	planters' company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish
 15734	government and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel
 15735	and construction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.
 15736	You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives,
 15737	oranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial
 15738	irrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name entered
 15739	for life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and the
 15740	balance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. 15.
 15741	
 15742	Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.
 15743	
 15744	He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered
 15745	olivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in
 15746	jars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows
 15747	the taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons
 15748	too. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin's parade. And Mastiansky
 15749	with the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in Citron's
 15750	basketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it
 15751	to the nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild
 15752	perfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high prices too,
 15753	Moisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.
 15754	Must be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar,
 15755	Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa,
 15756	chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in
 15757	soiled dungarees. There's whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesn't
 15758	see. Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back is like that
 15759	Norwegian captain's. Wonder if I'll meet him today. Watering cart. To
 15760	provoke the rain. On earth as it is in heaven.
 15761	
 15762	A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.
 15763	
 15764	No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead
 15765	sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those
 15766	waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it
 15767	raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead
 15768	names. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the
 15769	oldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy's, clutching a
 15770	naggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over
 15771	all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born
 15772	everywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old
 15773	woman's: the grey sunken cunt of the world.
 15774	
 15775	Desolation.
 15776	
 15777	Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned
 15778	into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins,
 15779	chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I am here
 15780	now. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong side of
 15781	the bed. Must begin again those Sandow's exercises. On the hands down.
 15782	Blotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why is that?
 15783	Valuation is only twenty-eight. Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur:
 15784	parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore eye. To smell
 15785	the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her
 15786	ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.
 15787	
 15788	Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim
 15789	sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a
 15790	girl with gold hair on the wind.
 15791	
 15792	Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered
 15793	them. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand.
 15794	Mrs Marion.
 15795	
 15796	--Poldy!
 15797	
 15798	Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm
 15799	yellow twilight towards her tousled head.
 15800	
 15801	--Who are the letters for?
 15802	
 15803	He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.
 15804	
 15805	--A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And
 15806	a letter for you.
 15807	
 15808	He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her
 15809	knees.
 15810	
 15811	--Do you want the blind up?
 15812	
 15813	Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her
 15814	glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.
 15815	
 15816	--That do? he asked, turning.
 15817	
 15818	She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.
 15819	
 15820	--She got the things, she said.
 15821	
 15822	He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back
 15823	slowly with a snug sigh.
 15824	
 15825	--Hurry up with that tea, she said. I'm parched.
 15826	
 15827	--The kettle is boiling, he said.
 15828	
 15829	But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
 15830	linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.
 15831	
 15832	As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:
 15833	
 15834	--Poldy!
 15835	
 15836	--What?
 15837	
 15838	--Scald the teapot.
 15839	
 15840	On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and
 15841	rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the
 15842	kettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off
 15843	the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump
 15844	of butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed
 15845	hungrily against him. Give her too much meat she won't mouse. Say they
 15846	won't eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to
 15847	her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. He
 15848	sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.
 15849	
 15850	Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks:
 15851	new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan's
 15852	seaside girls.
 15853	
 15854	The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown
 15855	
 15856	Derby, smiling. Silly Milly's birthday gift. Only five she was then. No,
 15857	wait: four. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces
 15858	of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.
 15859	
 15860	     _O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.
 15861	     You are my lookingglass from night to morning.
 15862	     I'd rather have you without a farthing
 15863	     Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden._
 15864	
 15865	
 15866	Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous
 15867	old chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And
 15868	the little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into
 15869	the parlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwin's hat! All we
 15870	laughed. Sex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.
 15871	
 15872	He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the
 15873	teapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on
 15874	it? Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it
 15875	upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.
 15876	
 15877	Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on
 15878	the chair by the bedhead.
 15879	
 15880	--What a time you were! she said.
 15881	
 15882	She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on
 15883	the pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft
 15884	bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat's udder. The warmth
 15885	of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the
 15886	tea she poured.
 15887	
 15888	A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the
 15889	act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.
 15890	
 15891	--Who was the letter from? he asked.
 15892	
 15893	Bold hand. Marion.
 15894	
 15895	--O, Boylan, she said. He's bringing the programme.
 15896	
 15897	--What are you singing?
 15898	
 15899	--_La ci darem_ with J. C. Doyle, she said, and _Love's Old Sweet Song_.
 15900	
 15901	Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves
 15902	next day. Like foul flowerwater.
 15903	
 15904	--Would you like the window open a little?
 15905	
 15906	She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:
 15907	
 15908	--What time is the funeral?
 15909	
 15910	--Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn't see the paper.
 15911	
 15912	Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled
 15913	drawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a
 15914	stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.
 15915	
 15916	--No: that book.
 15917	
 15918	Other stocking. Her petticoat.
 15919	
 15920	--It must have fell down, she said.
 15921	
 15922	He felt here and there. _Voglio e non vorrei_. Wonder if she pronounces
 15923	that right: _voglio_. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped
 15924	and lifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of
 15925	the orangekeyed chamberpot.
 15926	
 15927	--Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There's a word I wanted to
 15928	ask you.
 15929	
 15930	She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and,
 15931	having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the
 15932	text with the hairpin till she reached the word.
 15933	
 15934	--Met him what? he asked.
 15935	
 15936	--Here, she said. What does that mean?
 15937	
 15938	He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.
 15939	
 15940	--Metempsychosis?
 15941	
 15942	--Yes. Who's he when he's at home?
 15943	
 15944	--Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It's Greek: from the Greek. That
 15945	means the transmigration of souls.
 15946	
 15947	--O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.
 15948	
 15949	He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same young eyes.
 15950	The first night after the charades. Dolphin's Barn. He turned over
 15951	the smudged pages. _Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_. Hello. Illustration.
 15952	Fierce Italian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor
 15953	naked. Sheet kindly lent. _The monster Maffei desisted and flung his
 15954	victim from him with an oath_. Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals.
 15955	Trapeze at Hengler's. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping. Break your
 15956	neck and we'll break our sides. Families of them. Bone them young so
 15957	they metamspychosis. That we live after death. Our souls. That a man's
 15958	soul after he dies. Dignam's soul...
 15959	
 15960	--Did you finish it? he asked.
 15961	
 15962	--Yes, she said. There's nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with the
 15963	first fellow all the time?
 15964	
 15965	--Never read it. Do you want another?
 15966	
 15967	--Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock's. Nice name he has.
 15968	
 15969	She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.
 15970	
 15971	Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they'll write to
 15972	Kearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: that's the word.
 15973	
 15974	--Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body
 15975	after death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That
 15976	we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other
 15977	planet. They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past
 15978	lives.
 15979	
 15980	The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Bette remind
 15981	her of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An example?
 15982	
 15983	The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed. Given away with the Easter number
 15984	of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before you
 15985	put milk in. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and six
 15986	I gave for the frame. She said it would look nice over the bed. Naked
 15987	nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.
 15988	
 15989	He turned the pages back.
 15990	
 15991	--Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They
 15992	used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for
 15993	instance. What they called nymphs, for example.
 15994	
 15995	Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her,
 15996	inhaling through her arched nostrils.
 15997	
 15998	--There's a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?
 15999	
 16000	--The kidney! he cried suddenly.
 16001	
 16002	He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes
 16003	against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping
 16004	hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork's legs. Pungent smoke shot
 16005	up in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the
 16006	fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.
 16007	Only a little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the
 16008	scanty brown gravy trickle over it.
 16009	
 16010	Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.
 16011	He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a
 16012	forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant
 16013	meat. Done to a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of bread,
 16014	sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that about
 16015	some young student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side,
 16016	reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the
 16017	gravy and raising it to his mouth.
 16018	
 16019	Dearest Papli
 16020	
 16021	Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me
 16022	splendid. Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got
 16023	mummy's Iovely box of creams and am writing. They are lovely. I am
 16024	getting on swimming in the photo business now. Mr Coghlan took one of me
 16025	and Mrs. Will send when developed. We did great biz yesterday. Fair day
 16026	and all the beef to the heels were in. We are going to lough Owel on
 16027	Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic. Give my love to
 16028	mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks. I hear them at the piano
 16029	downstairs. There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.
 16030	There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his
 16031	cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan's (I was on the
 16032	pop of writing Blazes Boylan's) song about those seaside girls. Tell him
 16033	silly Milly sends my best respects. I must now close with fondest love
 16034	
 16035	Your fond daughter, MILLY.
 16036	
 16037	P. S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry. Byby. M.
 16038	
 16039	Fifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first
 16040	birthday away from home. Separation. Remember the summer morning she
 16041	was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Jolly old
 16042	woman. Lot of babies she must have helped into the world. She knew from
 16043	the first poor little Rudy wouldn't live. Well, God is good, sir. She
 16044	knew at once. He would be eleven now if he had lived.
 16045	
 16046	His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. Excuse bad writing.
 16047	Hurry. Piano downstairs. Coming out of her shell. Row with her in the
 16048	XL Cafe about the bracelet. Wouldn't eat her cakes or speak or look.
 16049	Saucebox. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after
 16050	piece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she might do
 16051	worse. Music hall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of cooler tea
 16052	to wash down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.
 16053	
 16054	O, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing has
 16055	happened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild
 16056	piece of goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny.
 16057	Ripening now.
 16058	
 16059	Vain: very.
 16060	
 16061	He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught
 16062	her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. Anemic a little.
 16063	Was given milk too long. On the ERIN'S KING that day round the Kish.
 16064	Damned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her pale blue scarf
 16065	loose in the wind with her hair. _All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your
 16066	head it simply swirls._
 16067	
 16068	
 16069	Seaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers' pockets,
 16070	jarvey off for the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says.
 16071	Pier with lamps, summer evening, band,
 16072	
 16073	     _Those girls, those girls,
 16074	     Those lovely seaside girls._
 16075	
 16076	
 16077	Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion.
 16078	Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,
 16079	braiding.
 16080	
 16081	A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen,
 16082	yes. Prevent. Useless: can't move. Girl's sweet light lips. Will happen
 16083	too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now.
 16084	Lips kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman's lips.
 16085	
 16086	Better where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass
 16087	the time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two
 16088	and six return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or
 16089	through M'Coy.
 16090	
 16091	The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,
 16092	nosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing.
 16093	Wants to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her wait.
 16094	Has the fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her ear
 16095	with her back to the fire too.
 16096	
 16097	He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up,
 16098	undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.
 16099	
 16100	--Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I'm ready.
 16101	
 16102	Heaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the
 16103	landing.
 16104	
 16105	A paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as
 16106	I'm.
 16107	
 16108	In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_. He folded it
 16109	under his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in
 16110	soft bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.
 16111	
 16112	Listening, he heard her voice:
 16113	
 16114	--Come, come, pussy. Come.
 16115	
 16116	He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen
 16117	towards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.
 16118	The maid was in the garden. Fine morning.
 16119	
 16120	He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.
 16121	Make a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to
 16122	manure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur.
 16123	All soil like that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this
 16124	that is? The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top
 16125	dressing. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are
 16126	fed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies' kid
 16127	gloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in
 16128	that corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Still gardens
 16129	have their drawbacks. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.
 16130	
 16131	He walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the
 16132	peg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny I don't remember that. Hallstand
 16133	too full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters.
 16134	Drago's shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown
 16135	brillantined hair over his collar. Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder
 16136	have I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox
 16137	there got away James Stephens, they say. O'Brien.
 16138	
 16139	Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss.
 16140	Enthusiast.
 16141	
 16142	He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to get
 16143	these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head
 16144	under the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy
 16145	limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he
 16146	peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in his
 16147	countinghouse. Nobody.
 16148	
 16149	Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over
 16150	on his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it a
 16151	bit. Our prize titbit: _Matcham's Masterstroke_. Written by Mr Philip
 16152	Beaufoy, Playgoers' Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea
 16153	a column has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds
 16154	three. Three pounds, thirteen and six.
 16155	
 16156	Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but
 16157	resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he
 16158	allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still
 16159	patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it's
 16160	not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One
 16161	tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or touch
 16162	him but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now. Silly
 16163	season. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat
 16164	certainly. _Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the
 16165	laughing witch who now_. Begins and ends morally. _Hand in hand_. Smart.
 16166	He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water
 16167	flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and
 16168	received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.
 16169	
 16170	Might manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for
 16171	some proverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she
 16172	said dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving. Biting
 16173	her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her. 9.l5.
 16174	Did Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23. What
 16175	possessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I'm swelled after that cabbage. A
 16176	speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.
 16177	
 16178	Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. Morning
 16179	after the bazaar dance when May's band played Ponchielli's dance of the
 16180	hours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then
 16181	night hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head
 16182	dancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money.
 16183	Why? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use
 16184	humming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The
 16185	mirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen
 16186	vest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes.
 16187	It wouldn't pan out somehow.
 16188	
 16189	Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers
 16190	and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.
 16191	Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.
 16192	
 16193	He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.
 16194	Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled
 16195	back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom
 16196	into the air.
 16197	
 16198	In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his
 16199	black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What time
 16200	is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.
 16201	
 16202	A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George's
 16203	church. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.
 16204	
 16205	     _Heigho! Heigho!
 16206	     Heigho! Heigho!
 16207	     Heigho! Heigho!_
 16208	
 16209	
 16210	Quarter to. There again: the overtone following through the air, third.
 16211	
 16212	Poor Dignam!
 16213	
 16214	
 16215	By lorries along sir John Rogerson's quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past
 16216	Windmill lane, Leask's the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.
 16217	Could have given that address too. And past the sailors' home. He turned
 16218	from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.
 16219	By Brady's cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal
 16220	linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of eczema
 16221	on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop. Tell
 16222	him if he smokes he won't grow. O let him! His life isn't such a bed of
 16223	roses. Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come home to ma, da.
 16224	Slack hour: won't be many there. He crossed Townsend street, passed
 16225	the frowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth. And past
 16226	Nichols' the undertaker. At eleven it is. Time enough. Daresay Corny
 16227	Kelleher bagged the job for O'Neill's. Singing with his eyes shut.
 16228	Corny. Met her once in the park. In the dark. What a lark. Police tout.
 16229	Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.
 16230	O, surely he bagged it. Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall. With my
 16231	tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.
 16232	
 16233	
 16234	In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental
 16235	Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,
 16236	finest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom
 16237	Kernan. Couldn't ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still read
 16238	blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his
 16239	right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning.
 16240	Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather
 16241	headband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down
 16242	into the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the
 16243	headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.
 16244	
 16245	So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and
 16246	hair. Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice
 16247	blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it
 16248	must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on,
 16249	cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. Wonder is it like
 16250	that. Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_,
 16251	not doing a hand's turn all day. Sleep six months out of twelve. Too hot
 16252	to quarrel. Influence of the climate. Lethargy. Flowers of idleness. The
 16253	air feeds most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens. Sensitive plants.
 16254	Waterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in the air. Walk on
 16255	roseleaves. Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. Where was the chap
 16256	I saw in that picture somewhere? Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his
 16257	back, reading a book with a parasol open. Couldn't sink if you tried: so
 16258	thick with salt. Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of
 16259	the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what? Or is it the
 16260	volume is equal to the weight? It's a law something like that. Vance in
 16261	High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum.
 16262	Cracking curriculum. What is weight really when you say the weight?
 16263	Thirtytwo feet per second per second. Law of falling bodies: per second
 16264	per second. They all fall to the ground. The earth. It's the force of
 16265	gravity of the earth is the weight.
 16266	
 16267	He turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with her
 16268	sausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_
 16269	from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and
 16270	tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless air:
 16271	just drop in to see. Per second per second. Per second for every second
 16272	it means. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of
 16273	the postoffice. Too late box. Post here. No-one. In.
 16274	
 16275	He handed the card through the brass grill.
 16276	
 16277	--Are there any letters for me? he asked.
 16278	
 16279	While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting
 16280	poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his
 16281	baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer
 16282	probably. Went too far last time.
 16283	
 16284	The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a
 16285	letter. He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.
 16286	
 16287	Henry Flower Esq, c/o P. O. Westland Row, City.
 16288	
 16289	Answered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket,
 16290	reviewing again the soldiers on parade. Where's old Tweedy's regiment?
 16291	Castoff soldier. There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he's a
 16292	grenadier. Pointed cuffs. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats.
 16293	Too showy. That must be why the women go after them. Uniform. Easier to
 16294	enlist and drill. Maud Gonne's letter about taking them off O'Connell
 16295	street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith's paper is on
 16296	the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or
 16297	halfseasover empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like. Eyes front.
 16298	Mark time. Table: able. Bed: ed. The King's own. Never see him dressed
 16299	up as a fireman or a bobby. A mason, yes.
 16300	
 16301	He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if
 16302	that would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger
 16303	felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.
 16304	Women will pay a lot of heed, I don't think. His fingers drew forth the
 16305	letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something
 16306	pinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.
 16307	
 16308	M'Coy. Get rid of him quickly. Take me out of my way. Hate company when
 16309	you.
 16310	
 16311	--Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?
 16312	
 16313	--Hello, M'Coy. Nowhere in particular.
 16314	
 16315	--How's the body?
 16316	
 16317	--Fine. How are you?
 16318	
 16319	--Just keeping alive, M'Coy said.
 16320	
 16321	His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:
 16322	
 16323	--Is there any... no trouble I hope? I see you're...
 16324	
 16325	--O, no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.
 16326	
 16327	--To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?
 16328	
 16329	A photo it isn't. A badge maybe.
 16330	
 16331	--E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.
 16332	
 16333	--I must try to get out there, M'Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard
 16334	it last night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?
 16335	
 16336	--I know.
 16337	
 16338	Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door
 16339	of the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She
 16340	stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her,
 16341	searched his pockets for change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll
 16342	collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. Careless
 16343	stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty
 16344	creature at the polo match. Women all for caste till you touch the spot.
 16345	Handsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The honourable
 16346	Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man. Possess her once take the starch
 16347	out of her.
 16348	
 16349	--I was with Bob Doran, he's on one of his periodical bends, and what do
 16350	you call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conway's we were.
 16351	
 16352	Doran Lyons in Conway's. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In came
 16353	Hoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath
 16354	his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the
 16355	braided drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight
 16356	perhaps. Talking of one thing or another. Lady's hand. Which side will
 16357	she get up?
 16358	
 16359	--And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?_ I
 16360	said. _Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.
 16361	
 16362	Off to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces
 16363	dangling. Wellturned foot. What is he foostering over that change for?
 16364	Sees me looking. Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two
 16365	strings to her bow.
 16366	
 16367	--_Why?_ I said. _What's wrong with him?_ I said.
 16368	
 16369	Proud: rich: silk stockings.
 16370	
 16371	--Yes, Mr Bloom said.
 16372	
 16373	He moved a little to the side of M'Coy's talking head. Getting up in a
 16374	minute.
 16375	
 16376	--_What's wrong with him_? He said. _He's dead_, he said. And, faith,
 16377	he filled up. _Is it Paddy Dignam_? I said. I couldn't believe it when I
 16378	heard it. I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in
 16379	the Arch. _Yes,_ he said. _He's gone. He died on Monday, poor fellow_.
 16380	Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!
 16381	
 16382	A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.
 16383	
 16384	Lost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise and
 16385	the peri. Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace
 16386	street hallway Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering
 16387	the display of _esprit de corps_. Well, what are you gaping at?
 16388	
 16389	--Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.
 16390	
 16391	--One of the best, M'Coy said.
 16392	
 16393	The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich
 16394	gloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her
 16395	hat in the sun: flicker, flick.
 16396	
 16397	--Wife well, I suppose? M'Coy's changed voice said.
 16398	
 16399	--O, yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.
 16400	
 16401	He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:
 16402	
 16403	_What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat? Incomplete With it an
 16404	abode of bliss._
 16405	
 16406	--My missus has just got an engagement. At least it's not settled yet.
 16407	
 16408	Valise tack again. By the way no harm. I'm off that, thanks.
 16409	
 16410	Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.
 16411	
 16412	--My wife too, he said. She's going to sing at a swagger affair in the
 16413	Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twenty-fifth.
 16414	
 16415	--That so? M'Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who's getting it up?
 16416	
 16417	Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.
 16418	No book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens. Dark lady
 16419	and fair man. Letter. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of envelope.
 16420	
 16421	     _Love's
 16422	     Old
 16423	     Sweet
 16424	     Song
 16425	     Comes lo-ove's old..._
 16426	
 16427	--It's a kind of a tour, don't you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.
 16428	_Sweeeet song_. There's a committee formed. Part shares and part
 16429	profits.
 16430	
 16431	M'Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.
 16432	
 16433	--O, well, he said. That's good news.
 16434	
 16435	He moved to go.
 16436	
 16437	--Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.
 16438	
 16439	--Yes, Mr Bloom said.
 16440	
 16441	--Tell you what, M'Coy said. You might put down my name at the funeral,
 16442	will you? I'd like to go but I mightn't be able, you see. There's a
 16443	drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself
 16444	would have to go down if the body is found. You just shove in my name if
 16445	I'm not there, will you?
 16446	
 16447	--I'll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That'll be all right.
 16448	
 16449	--Right, M'Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I'd go if I possibly
 16450	could. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M'Coy will do.
 16451	
 16452	--That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.
 16453	
 16454	Didn't catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I'd
 16455	like my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped
 16456	corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him
 16457	his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of
 16458	it from that good day to this.
 16459	
 16460	Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has just
 16461	got an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in its
 16462	way: for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don't you know:
 16463	in the same boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would. Can't
 16464	he hear the difference? Think he's that way inclined a bit. Against
 16465	my grain somehow. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope that
 16466	smallpox up there doesn't get worse. Suppose she wouldn't let herself be
 16467	vaccinated again. Your wife and my wife.
 16468	
 16469	Wonder is he pimping after me?
 16470	
 16471	Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured
 16472	hoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane's Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery's Summer
 16473	Sale. No, he's going on straight. Hello. _Leah_ tonight. Mrs Bandmann
 16474	Palmer. Like to see her again in that. _Hamlet_ she played last night.
 16475	Male impersonator. Perhaps he was a woman. Why Ophelia committed
 16476	suicide. Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that. Outside
 16477	the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in. Year before
 16478	I was born that was: sixtyfive. And Ristori in Vienna. What is this the
 16479	right name is? By Mosenthal it is. Rachel, is it? No. The scene he was
 16480	always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice
 16481	and puts his fingers on his face.
 16482	
 16483	Nathan's voice! His son's voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his
 16484	father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his
 16485	father and left the God of his father.
 16486	
 16487	Every word is so deep, Leopold.
 16488	
 16489	Poor papa! Poor man! I'm glad I didn't go into the room to look at his
 16490	face. That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for
 16491	him.
 16492	
 16493	Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the
 16494	hazard. No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn't met
 16495	that M'Coy fellow.
 16496	
 16497	He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing
 16498	teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet
 16499	oaten reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn all they
 16500	know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.
 16501	Too full for words. Still they get their feed all right and their doss.
 16502	Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their
 16503	haunches. Might be happy all the same that way. Good poor brutes they
 16504	look. Still their neigh can be very irritating.
 16505	
 16506	He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he
 16507	carried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.
 16508	
 16509	He passed the cabman's shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies.
 16510	All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own. _Voglio
 16511	e non_. Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a few flying
 16512	syllables as they pass. He hummed:
 16513	
 16514	     _La ci darem la mano
 16515	     La la lala la la._
 16516	
 16517	He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the
 16518	lee of the station wall. No-one. Meade's timberyard. Piled balks. Ruins
 16519	and tenements. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with
 16520	its forgotten pickeystone. Not a sinner. Near the timberyard a squatted
 16521	child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. A wise
 16522	tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. Pity to disturb
 16523	them. Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her. Open it.
 16524	And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame's school. She
 16525	liked mignonette. Mrs Ellis's. And Mr? He opened the letter within the
 16526	newspaper.
 16527	
 16528	A flower. I think it's a. A yellow flower with flattened petals. Not
 16529	annoyed then? What does she say?
 16530	
 16531	Dear Henry
 16532	
 16533	I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry
 16534	you did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am
 16535	awfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called
 16536	you naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me
 16537	what is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home
 16538	you poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you.
 16539	Please tell me what you think of poor me. I often think of the beautiful
 16540	name you have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you so often
 16541	you have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as
 16542	you. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell me
 16543	more. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what I
 16544	will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to
 16545	meet you. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are
 16546	exhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I
 16547	have such a bad headache. today. and write _by return_ to your longing
 16548	
 16549	Martha
 16550	
 16551	P. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to
 16552	know.
 16553	
 16554	He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell
 16555	and placed it in his heart pocket. Language of flowers. They like it
 16556	because no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then
 16557	walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and
 16558	there a word. Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus
 16559	if you don't please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses
 16560	when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha's perfume.
 16561	Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his
 16562	sidepocket.
 16563	
 16564	Weak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did she
 16565	wrote it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me,
 16566	respectable character. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary. Thank
 16567	you: not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running round corners.
 16568	Bad as a row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic. Go
 16569	further next time. Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.
 16570	Brutal, why not? Try it anyhow. A bit at a time.
 16571	
 16572	Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.
 16573	Common pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere:
 16574	pinned together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses
 16575	without thorns.
 16576	
 16577	Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in the
 16578	Coombe, linked together in the rain.
 16579	
 16580	     _O, Mary lost the pin of her drawers.
 16581	     She didn't know what to do
 16582	     To keep it up
 16583	     To keep it up._
 16584	
 16585	It? Them. Such a bad headache. Has her roses probably. Or sitting all
 16586	day typing. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. What perfume does your wife
 16587	use. Now could you make out a thing like that?
 16588	
 16589	     _To keep it up._
 16590	
 16591	Martha, Mary. I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or
 16592	faked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious. Also
 16593	the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.
 16594	
 16595	     _To keep it up._
 16596	
 16597	Nice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there:
 16598	quiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have been,
 16599	strange customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper:
 16600	fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole
 16601	in the wall at Ashtown. Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the
 16602	trottingmatches. She listens with big dark soft eyes. Tell her: more and
 16603	more: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.
 16604	
 16605	Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly
 16606	in shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered
 16607	away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.
 16608	
 16609	Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the
 16610	same way. Simple bit of paper. Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure
 16611	cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be
 16612	made out of porter. Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change
 16613	his shirt four times a day, they say. Skin breeds lice or vermin. A
 16614	million pounds, wait a moment. Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart,
 16615	eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.
 16616	One and four into twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly. Fifteen millions
 16617	of barrels of porter.
 16618	
 16619	What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the same.
 16620	
 16621	An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.
 16622	Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.
 16623	The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing
 16624	together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy
 16625	pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.
 16626	
 16627	He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the porch
 16628	he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again
 16629	behind the leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work M'Coy
 16630	for a pass to Mullingar.
 16631	
 16632	Same notice on the door. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.J.
 16633	on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African Mission. Prayers for the
 16634	conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious. The
 16635	protestants are the same. Convert Dr William J. Walsh D.D. to the true
 16636	religion. Save China's millions. Wonder how they explain it to the
 16637	heathen Chinee. Prefer an ounce of opium. Celestials. Rank heresy for
 16638	them. Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum. Taking it easy
 16639	with hand under his cheek. Josssticks burning. Not like Ecce Homo. Crown
 16640	of thorns and cross. Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock. Chopsticks?
 16641	Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking. Sorry I
 16642	didn't work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that
 16643	Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn't. They're taught that. He's
 16644	not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise
 16645	blacks, is he? The glasses would take their fancy, flashing. Like to see
 16646	them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening. Still
 16647	life. Lap it up like milk, I suppose.
 16648	
 16649	The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps,
 16650	pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.
 16651	
 16652	Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place
 16653	to be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow
 16654	music. That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the
 16655	benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch
 16656	knelt at the altarrails. The priest went along by them, murmuring,
 16657	holding the thing in his hands. He stopped at each, took out a
 16658	communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it
 16659	neatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank. Then the next one. Her hat
 16660	sank at once. Then the next one: a small old woman. The priest bent down
 16661	to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next one.
 16662	Shut your eyes and open your mouth. What? _Corpus:_ body. Corpse. Good
 16663	idea the Latin. Stupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They
 16664	don't seem to chew it: only swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a
 16665	corpse. Why the cannibals cotton to it.
 16666	
 16667	He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by
 16668	one, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in
 16669	its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear.
 16670	We ought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here
 16671	and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for
 16672	it to melt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it's that
 16673	sort of bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes
 16674	them feel happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it's called.
 16675	There's a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.
 16676	First communicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one family
 16677	party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I'm sure of
 16678	that. Not so lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit spreeish.
 16679	Let off steam. Thing is if you really believe in it. Lourdes cure,
 16680	waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding. Old
 16681	fellow asleep near that confessionbox. Hence those snores. Blind faith.
 16682	Safe in the arms of kingdom come. Lulls all pain. Wake this time next
 16683	year.
 16684	
 16685	He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an
 16686	instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace
 16687	affair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn't know what
 16688	to do to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S.
 16689	Molly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have
 16690	suffered, it is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.
 16691	
 16692	Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up with
 16693	a veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be here
 16694	with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the
 16695	sly. Their character. That fellow that turned queen's evidence on the
 16696	invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion
 16697	every morning. This very church. Peter Carey, yes. No, Peter Claver I am
 16698	thinking of. Denis Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six children
 16699	at home. And plotting that murder all the time. Those crawthumpers,
 16700	now that's a good name for them, there's always something shiftylooking
 16701	about them. They're not straight men of business either. O, no, she's
 16702	not here: the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up that envelope?
 16703	Yes: under the bridge.
 16704	
 16705	The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs
 16706	smartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank
 16707	what they are used to Guinness's porter or some temperance beverage
 16708	Wheatley's Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane's ginger ale
 16709	(aromatic). Doesn't give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.
 16710	Cold comfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they'd have one old
 16711	booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer the
 16712	whole atmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly right that is.
 16713	
 16714	Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music. Pity.
 16715	Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make that
 16716	instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he had in
 16717	Gardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat Mater_
 16718	of Rossini. Father Bernard Vaughan's sermon first. Christ or Pilate?
 16719	Christ, but don't keep us all night over it. Music they wanted.
 16720	Footdrill stopped. Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice
 16721	against that corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the
 16722	people looking up:
 16723	
 16724	_Quis est homo._
 16725	
 16726	Some of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven last words.
 16727	Mozart's twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that. Those old popes keen on music,
 16728	on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example
 16729	too. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too, chanting,
 16730	regular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse. Still,
 16731	having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick. What kind
 16732	of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.
 16733	Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn't feel anything after. Kind of a
 16734	placid. No worry. Fall into flesh, don't they? Gluttons, tall, long
 16735	legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.
 16736	
 16737	He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and
 16738	bless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom
 16739	glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand
 16740	up at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again
 16741	and he sat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the
 16742	altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered
 16743	each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a
 16744	card:
 16745	
 16746	--O God, our refuge and our strength...
 16747	
 16748	Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them
 16749	the bone. I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Glorious
 16750	and immaculate virgin. Joseph, her spouse. Peter and Paul. More
 16751	interesting if you understood what it was all about. Wonderful
 16752	organisation certainly, goes like clockwork. Confession. Everyone wants
 16753	to. Then I will tell you all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon
 16754	in their hands. More than doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to. And I
 16755	schschschschschsch. And did you chachachachacha? And why did you? Look
 16756	down at her ring to find an excuse. Whispering gallery walls have ears.
 16757	Husband learn to his surprise. God's little joke. Then out she comes.
 16758	Repentance skindeep. Lovely shame. Pray at an altar. Hail Mary and Holy
 16759	Mary. Flowers, incense, candles melting. Hide her blushes. Salvation
 16760	army blatant imitation. Reformed prostitute will address the meeting.
 16761	How I found the Lord. Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they
 16762	work the whole show. And don't they rake in the money too? Bequests
 16763	also: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute discretion.
 16764	Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.
 16765	Monasteries and convents. The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the
 16766	witnessbox. No browbeating him. He had his answer pat for everything.
 16767	Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The doctors of the
 16768	church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.
 16769	
 16770	The priest prayed:
 16771	
 16772	--Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be
 16773	our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God
 16774	restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly
 16775	host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those
 16776	other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.
 16777	
 16778	The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women
 16779	remained behind: thanksgiving.
 16780	
 16781	Better be shoving along. Brother Buzz. Come around with the plate
 16782	perhaps. Pay your Easter duty.
 16783	
 16784	He stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the
 16785	time? Women enjoy it. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there's a
 16786	(whh!) just a (whh!) fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.
 16787	Glimpses of the moon. Annoyed if you don't. Why didn't you tell me
 16788	before. Still like you better untidy. Good job it wasn't farther south.
 16789	He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main
 16790	door into the light. He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble
 16791	bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in
 16792	the low tide of holy water. Trams: a car of Prescott's dyeworks: a widow
 16793	in her weeds. Notice because I'm in mourning myself. He covered himself.
 16794	How goes the time? Quarter past. Time enough yet. Better get that lotion
 16795	made up. Where is this? Ah yes, the last time. Sweny's in Lincoln place.
 16796	Chemists rarely move. Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir.
 16797	Hamilton Long's, founded in the year of the flood. Huguenot churchyard
 16798	near there. Visit some day.
 16799	
 16800	He walked southward along Westland row. But the recipe is in the other
 16801	trousers. O, and I forgot that latchkey too. Bore this funeral affair.
 16802	O well, poor fellow, it's not his fault. When was it I got it made up
 16803	last? Wait. I changed a sovereign I remember. First of the month it must
 16804	have been or the second. O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.
 16805	
 16806	The chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he seems
 16807	to have. Shrunken skull. And old. Quest for the philosopher's stone. The
 16808	alchemists. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Lethargy then. Why?
 16809	Reaction. A lifetime in a night. Gradually changes your character.
 16810	Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants. All his
 16811	alabaster lilypots. Mortar and pestle. Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te Virid.
 16812	Smell almost cure you like the dentist's doorbell. Doctor Whack. He
 16813	ought to physic himself a bit. Electuary or emulsion. The first fellow
 16814	that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck. Simples. Want to
 16815	be careful. Enough stuff here to chloroform you. Test: turns blue
 16816	litmus paper red. Chloroform. Overdose of laudanum. Sleeping draughts.
 16817	Lovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Clogs the pores or the
 16818	phlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy where you least expect it. Clever
 16819	of nature.
 16820	
 16821	--About a fortnight ago, sir?
 16822	
 16823	--Yes, Mr Bloom said.
 16824	
 16825	He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the
 16826	dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling
 16827	your aches and pains.
 16828	
 16829	--Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then
 16830	orangeflower water...
 16831	
 16832	It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.
 16833	
 16834	--And white wax also, he said.
 16835	
 16836	Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to
 16837	her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my
 16838	cuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the
 16839	teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.
 16840	Skinfood. One of the old queen's sons, duke of Albany was it? had only
 16841	one skin. Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to
 16842	make it worse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your? _Peau
 16843	d'Espagne_. That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps
 16844	have. Pure curd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam.
 16845	Turkish. Massage. Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice
 16846	girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious longing
 16847	I. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time for
 16848	massage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.
 16849	
 16850	--Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a
 16851	bottle?
 16852	
 16853	--No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I'll call later in the day and
 16854	I'll take one of these soaps. How much are they?
 16855	
 16856	--Fourpence, sir.
 16857	
 16858	Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.
 16859	
 16860	--I'll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.
 16861	
 16862	--Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you
 16863	come back.
 16864	
 16865	--Good, Mr Bloom said.
 16866	
 16867	He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the
 16868	coolwrappered soap in his left hand.
 16869	
 16870	At his armpit Bantam Lyons' voice and hand said:
 16871	
 16872	--Hello, Bloom. What's the best news? Is that today's? Show us a minute.
 16873	
 16874	Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look
 16875	younger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.
 16876	
 16877	Bantam Lyons's yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a
 16878	wash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears'
 16879	soap? Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.
 16880	
 16881	--I want to see about that French horse that's running today, Bantam
 16882	Lyons said. Where the bugger is it?
 16883	
 16884	He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.
 16885	Barber's itch. Tight collar he'll lose his hair. Better leave him the
 16886	paper and get shut of him.
 16887	
 16888	--You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.
 16889	
 16890	--Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximum the
 16891	second.
 16892	
 16893	--I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.
 16894	
 16895	Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.
 16896	
 16897	--What's that? his sharp voice said.
 16898	
 16899	--I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it away
 16900	that moment.
 16901	
 16902	Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread
 16903	sheets back on Mr Bloom's arms.
 16904	
 16905	--I'll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.
 16906	
 16907	He sped off towards Conway's corner. God speed scut.
 16908	
 16909	Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap
 16910	in it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed of it
 16911	lately. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for large
 16912	tender turkey. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Fleming
 16913	embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America. Keeps a hotel now.
 16914	They never come back. Fleshpots of Egypt.
 16915	
 16916	He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of a
 16917	mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. He
 16918	eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled
 16919	up like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it round
 16920	like a wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big:
 16921	college. Something to catch the eye.
 16922	
 16923	There's Hornblower standing at the porter's lodge. Keep him on hands:
 16924	might take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, Mr Hornblower? How
 16925	do you do, sir?
 16926	
 16927	Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather.
 16928	Sit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can't play it
 16929	here. Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Culler broke a window in the
 16930	Kildare street club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more
 16931	in their line. And the skulls we were acracking when M'Carthy took the
 16932	floor. Heatwave. Won't last. Always passing, the stream of life, which
 16933	in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.
 16934	
 16935	Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid
 16936	stream. This is my body.
 16937	
 16938	He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of
 16939	warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his
 16940	trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,
 16941	lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of
 16942	his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of
 16943	thousands, a languid floating flower.
 16944	
 16945	
 16946	
 16947	Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
 16948	carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after
 16949	him, curving his height with care.
 16950	
 16951	--Come on, Simon.
 16952	
 16953	--After you, Mr Bloom said.
 16954	
 16955	Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:
 16956	
 16957	Yes, yes.
 16958	
 16959	--Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.
 16960	
 16961	Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to
 16962	after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm
 16963	through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow
 16964	at the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman
 16965	peeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she
 16966	was passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad
 16967	to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them.
 16968	Huggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd
 16969	wake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making
 16970	the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who
 16971	will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and
 16972	the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same after. Unclean
 16973	job.
 16974	
 16975	All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am
 16976	sitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shift
 16977	it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.
 16978	
 16979	All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:
 16980	then horses' hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and
 16981	swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of
 16982	the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. At
 16983	walking pace.
 16984	
 16985	They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
 16986	passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels
 16987	rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook
 16988	rattling in the doorframes.
 16989	
 16990	--What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.
 16991	
 16992	--Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.
 16993	
 16994	Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.
 16995	
 16996	--That's a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died
 16997	out.
 16998	
 16999	All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by
 17000	passers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the
 17001	smoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,
 17002	clad in mourning, a wide hat.
 17003	
 17004	--There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.
 17005	
 17006	--Who is that?
 17007	
 17008	--Your son and heir.
 17009	
 17010	--Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.
 17011	
 17012	The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway
 17013	before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back
 17014	to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus
 17015	fell back, saying:
 17016	
 17017	--Was that Mulligan cad with him? His _fidus Achates_!
 17018	
 17019	--No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.
 17020	
 17021	--Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding
 17022	faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa's little lump
 17023	of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.
 17024	
 17025	Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the
 17026	bottleworks: Dodder bridge.
 17027	
 17028	Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls
 17029	the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing
 17030	in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the
 17031	landlady's two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night.
 17032	Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing
 17033	his back. Thinks he'll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are.
 17034	About six hundred per cent profit.
 17035	
 17036	--He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a
 17037	contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks
 17038	all over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'll
 17039	make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother
 17040	or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.
 17041	I'll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.
 17042	
 17043	He cried above the clatter of the wheels:
 17044	
 17045	--I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper's
 17046	son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. Not likely.
 17047	
 17048	He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power's mild
 17049	face and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy
 17050	selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If
 17051	little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house.
 17052	Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange
 17053	feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning
 17054	in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by
 17055	the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up. She had
 17056	that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us a touch,
 17057	Poldy. God, I'm dying for it. How life begins.
 17058	
 17059	Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her.
 17060	I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn
 17061	German too.
 17062	
 17063	--Are we late? Mr Power asked.
 17064	
 17065	--Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.
 17066	
 17067	Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping
 17068	Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she's a dear girl. Soon be a
 17069	woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too.
 17070	Life, life.
 17071	
 17072	The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.
 17073	
 17074	--Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.
 17075	
 17076	--He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him. Do
 17077	you follow me?
 17078	
 17079	He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away
 17080	crustcrumbs from under his thighs.
 17081	
 17082	--What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?
 17083	
 17084	--Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power
 17085	said.
 17086	
 17087	All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless
 17088	leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward
 17089	and said:
 17090	
 17091	--Unless I'm greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?
 17092	
 17093	--It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.
 17094	
 17095	Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite
 17096	clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.
 17097	
 17098	Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.
 17099	
 17100	--After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world.
 17101	
 17102	--Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of
 17103	his beard gently.
 17104	
 17105	--Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.
 17106	
 17107	--And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.
 17108	
 17109	--At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.
 17110	
 17111	--I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he'd try to come.
 17112	
 17113	The carriage halted short.
 17114	
 17115	--What's wrong?
 17116	
 17117	--We're stopped.
 17118	
 17119	--Where are we?
 17120	
 17121	Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.
 17122	
 17123	--The grand canal, he said.
 17124	
 17125	Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got
 17126	it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame
 17127	really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed
 17128	tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don't miss
 17129	this chance. Dogs' home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,
 17130	Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave.
 17131	A dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men's
 17132	dogs usually are.
 17133	
 17134	A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower
 17135	spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander.
 17136	I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.
 17137	
 17138	--The weather is changing, he said quietly.
 17139	
 17140	--A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.
 17141	
 17142	--Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There's the sun again coming
 17143	out.
 17144	
 17145	Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a
 17146	mute curse at the sky.
 17147	
 17148	--It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said.
 17149	
 17150	--We're off again.
 17151	
 17152	The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed
 17153	gently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.
 17154	
 17155	--Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking
 17156	him off to his face.
 17157	
 17158	--O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear
 17159	him, Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of _The Croppy Boy_.
 17160	
 17161	--Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. _His singing of that simple
 17162	ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the
 17163	whole course of my experience._
 17164	
 17165	--Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He's dead nuts on that. And the
 17166	retrospective arrangement.
 17167	
 17168	--Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? Martin Cunningham asked.
 17169	
 17170	--I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?
 17171	
 17172	--In the paper this morning.
 17173	
 17174	Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change
 17175	for her.
 17176	
 17177	--No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.
 17178	
 17179	Mr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the
 17180	deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what
 17181	Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? no, Sexton,
 17182	Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.
 17183	Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of
 17184	his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month's mind: Quinlan. On
 17185	whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.
 17186	
 17187	_It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky
 17188	While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him
 17189	on high._
 17190	
 17191	I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it
 17192	in the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry
 17193	fled. Before my patience are exhausted.
 17194	
 17195	National school. Meade's yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding.
 17196	Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round
 17197	with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their
 17198	hats.
 17199	
 17200	A pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a
 17201	tramway standard by Mr Bloom's window. Couldn't they invent something
 17202	automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow
 17203	would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job
 17204	making the new invention?
 17205	
 17206	Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a
 17207	crape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law
 17208	perhaps.
 17209	
 17210	They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway
 17211	bridge, past the Queen's theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene
 17212	Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see LEAH tonight, I wonder.
 17213	I said I. Or the _Lily of Killarney_? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big
 17214	powerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. _Fun on the Bristol_.
 17215	Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a
 17216	drink or two. As broad as it's long.
 17217	
 17218	He's coming in the afternoon. Her songs.
 17219	
 17220	Plasto's. Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. Who was he?
 17221	
 17222	--How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in
 17223	salute.
 17224	
 17225	--He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?
 17226	
 17227	--Who? Mr Dedalus asked.
 17228	
 17229	--Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.
 17230	
 17231	Just that moment I was thinking.
 17232	
 17233	Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the
 17234	white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.
 17235	
 17236	Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
 17237	hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?
 17238	Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes
 17239	feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I
 17240	am just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body
 17241	getting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes
 17242	that? I suppose the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh
 17243	falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders.
 17244	Hips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks
 17245	behind.
 17246	
 17247	He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant
 17248	glance over their faces.
 17249	
 17250	Mr Power asked:
 17251	
 17252	--How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?
 17253	
 17254	--O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It's a good
 17255	idea, you see...
 17256	
 17257	--Are you going yourself?
 17258	
 17259	--Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the
 17260	county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the
 17261	chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.
 17262	
 17263	--Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.
 17264	
 17265	Have you good artists?
 17266	
 17267	--Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we'll have all
 17268	topnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in
 17269	fact.
 17270	
 17271	--And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.
 17272	
 17273	Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped
 17274	them. Smith O'Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman.
 17275	Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by
 17276	Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.
 17277	
 17278	Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his
 17279	mouth opening: oot.
 17280	
 17281	--Four bootlaces for a penny.
 17282	
 17283	Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street.
 17284	Same house as Molly's namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.
 17285	Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too.
 17286	Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.
 17287	O'Callaghan on his last legs.
 17288	
 17289	And _Madame_. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing
 17290	her hair, humming. _voglio e non vorrei_. No. _vorrei e non_. Looking at
 17291	the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. _Mi trema un poco
 17292	il_. Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A
 17293	throstle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.
 17294	
 17295	His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. Greyish over
 17296	the ears. _Madame_: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way.
 17297	Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the
 17298	woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it
 17299	told me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played
 17300	out pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her
 17301	a pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury's. Or the
 17302	Moira, was it?
 17303	
 17304	They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator's form.
 17305	
 17306	Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.
 17307	
 17308	--Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.
 17309	
 17310	A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner
 17311	of Elvery's Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.
 17312	
 17313	--In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.
 17314	
 17315	Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:
 17316	
 17317	--The devil break the hasp of your back!
 17318	
 17319	Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the
 17320	carriage passed Gray's statue.
 17321	
 17322	--We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.
 17323	
 17324	His eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:
 17325	
 17326	--Well, nearly all of us.
 17327	
 17328	Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces.
 17329	
 17330	--That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J and
 17331	the son.
 17332	
 17333	--About the boatman? Mr Power asked.
 17334	
 17335	--Yes. Isn't it awfully good?
 17336	
 17337	--What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn't hear it.
 17338	
 17339	--There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to
 17340	send him to the Isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were both
 17341	...
 17342	
 17343	--What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?
 17344	
 17345	--Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried
 17346	to drown...
 17347	
 17348	--Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!
 17349	
 17350	Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.
 17351	
 17352	--No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself...
 17353	
 17354	Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:
 17355	
 17356	--Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on
 17357	their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got
 17358	loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.
 17359	
 17360	--For God's sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?
 17361	
 17362	--Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished
 17363	him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father
 17364	on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.
 17365	
 17366	--Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is...
 17367	
 17368	--And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
 17369	saving his son's life.
 17370	
 17371	A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand.
 17372	
 17373	--O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.
 17374	
 17375	--Isn't it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.
 17376	
 17377	--One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.
 17378	
 17379	Mr Power's choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.
 17380	
 17381	Nelson's pillar.
 17382	
 17383	--Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!
 17384	
 17385	--We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.
 17386	
 17387	Mr Dedalus sighed.
 17388	
 17389	--Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a laugh.
 17390	Many a good one he told himself.
 17391	
 17392	--The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his
 17393	fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and
 17394	he was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this. He's
 17395	gone from us.
 17396	
 17397	--As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went
 17398	very suddenly.
 17399	
 17400	--Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.
 17401	
 17402	He tapped his chest sadly.
 17403	
 17404	Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose.
 17405	Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent
 17406	colouring it.
 17407	
 17408	Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.
 17409	
 17410	--He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.
 17411	
 17412	--The best death, Mr Bloom said.
 17413	
 17414	Their wide open eyes looked at him.
 17415	
 17416	--No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.
 17417	
 17418	No-one spoke.
 17419	
 17420	Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents,
 17421	temperance hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college,
 17422	Gill's, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or
 17423	wind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the
 17424	late Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.
 17425	
 17426	White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,
 17427	galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning
 17428	coach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for
 17429	a nun.
 17430	
 17431	--Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.
 17432	
 17433	A dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's body,
 17434	weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society
 17435	pays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant
 17436	nothing. Mistake of nature. If it's healthy it's from the mother. If not
 17437	from the man. Better luck next time.
 17438	
 17439	--Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It's well out of it.
 17440	
 17441	The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his
 17442	bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.
 17443	
 17444	--In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.
 17445	
 17446	--But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own
 17447	life.
 17448	
 17449	Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.
 17450	
 17451	--The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.
 17452	
 17453	--Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We
 17454	must take a charitable view of it.
 17455	
 17456	--They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.
 17457	
 17458	--It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.
 17459	
 17460	Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham's
 17461	large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.
 17462	Like Shakespeare's face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy
 17463	on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive
 17464	a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn't broken
 17465	already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the riverbed
 17466	clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife
 17467	of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the
 17468	furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the
 17469	damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start
 17470	afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight
 17471	that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and
 17472	capering with Martin's umbrella.
 17473	
 17474	     _And they call me the jewel of Asia,
 17475	     Of Asia,
 17476	     The Geisha._
 17477	
 17478	He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.
 17479	
 17480	That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The
 17481	room in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through
 17482	the slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner's sunlit ears, big and
 17483	hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like
 17484	yellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.
 17485	Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son
 17486	Leopold.
 17487	
 17488	No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.
 17489	
 17490	The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.
 17491	
 17492	--We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.
 17493	
 17494	--God grant he doesn't upset us on the road, Mr Power said.
 17495	
 17496	--I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow
 17497	in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.
 17498	
 17499	--Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.
 17500	
 17501	As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent
 17502	over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody
 17503	here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from _Saul._ He's
 17504	as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The _Mater
 17505	Misericordiae_. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward for
 17506	incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady's Hospice for the dying.
 17507	Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They look
 17508	terrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the
 17509	spoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student
 17510	that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He's gone over to the
 17511	lying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other. The
 17512	carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.
 17513	
 17514	--What's wrong now?
 17515	
 17516	A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching
 17517	by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony
 17518	croups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their
 17519	fear.
 17520	
 17521	--Emigrants, Mr Power said.
 17522	
 17523	--Huuuh! the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.
 17524	
 17525	Huuuh! out of that!
 17526	
 17527	Thursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them
 17528	about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for old
 17529	England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter
 17530	lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a
 17531	year. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,
 17532	soap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off
 17533	the train at Clonsilla.
 17534	
 17535	The carriage moved on through the drove.
 17536	
 17537	--I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the
 17538	parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken
 17539	in trucks down to the boats.
 17540	
 17541	--Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite
 17542	right. They ought to.
 17543	
 17544	--Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have
 17545	municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line
 17546	out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage
 17547	and all. Don't you see what I mean?
 17548	
 17549	--O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon
 17550	diningroom.
 17551	
 17552	--A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.
 17553	
 17554	--Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn't it be more decent
 17555	than galloping two abreast?
 17556	
 17557	--Well, there's something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.
 17558	
 17559	--And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn't have scenes like that when
 17560	the hearse capsized round Dunphy's and upset the coffin on to the road.
 17561	
 17562	--That was terrible, Mr Power's shocked face said, and the corpse fell
 17563	about the road. Terrible!
 17564	
 17565	--First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.
 17566	
 17567	--Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.
 17568	
 17569	Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam
 17570	shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large
 17571	for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what's up now.
 17572	Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose
 17573	quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax.
 17574	The sphincter loose. Seal up all.
 17575	
 17576	--Dunphy's, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.
 17577	
 17578	Dunphy's corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A
 17579	pause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we'll pull up
 17580	here on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation.
 17581	Elixir of life.
 17582	
 17583	But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him
 17584	in the knocking about? He would and he wouldn't, I suppose. Depends on
 17585	where. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It
 17586	would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.
 17587	
 17588	In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted
 17589	by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.
 17590	
 17591	Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.
 17592	
 17593	Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his
 17594	dropping barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a
 17595	slacktethered horse. Aboard of the _Bugabu._
 17596	
 17597	Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his
 17598	raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of
 17599	reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,
 17600	Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or
 17601	cycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at
 17602	the auction but a lady's. Developing waterways. James M'Cann's hobby
 17603	to row me o'er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats.
 17604	Camping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without
 17605	writing. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by
 17606	lock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his
 17607	brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.
 17608	
 17609	They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.
 17610	
 17611	--I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.
 17612	
 17613	--Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.
 17614	
 17615	--How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?
 17616	
 17617	--Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.
 17618	
 17619	The carriage steered left for Finglas road.
 17620	
 17621	The stonecutter's yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of
 17622	land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,
 17623	knelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence:
 17624	appealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder and
 17625	sculptor.
 17626	
 17627	Passed.
 17628	
 17629	On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton's, an old tramp sat,
 17630	grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown
 17631	yawning boot. After life's journey.
 17632	
 17633	Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.
 17634	
 17635	Mr Power pointed.
 17636	
 17637	--That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.
 17638	
 17639	--So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.
 17640	Murdered his brother. Or so they said.
 17641	
 17642	--The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.
 17643	
 17644	--Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That's the maxim of the
 17645	law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person
 17646	to be wrongfully condemned.
 17647	
 17648	They looked. Murderer's ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered, tenantless,
 17649	unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned. Murder.
 17650	The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered. They love reading about
 17651	it. Man's head found in a garden. Her clothing consisted of. How she met
 17652	her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used. Murderer is still at large.
 17653	Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed. Murder will out.
 17654	
 17655	Cramped in this carriage. She mightn't like me to come that way without
 17656	letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with
 17657	their pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.
 17658	
 17659	The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,
 17660	rare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the
 17661	trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain
 17662	gestures on the air.
 17663	
 17664	The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put
 17665	out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with
 17666	his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.
 17667	
 17668	Change that soap now. Mr Bloom's hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
 17669	and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.
 17670	He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand
 17671	still held.
 17672	
 17673	Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It's all the same.
 17674	Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death.
 17675	Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and
 17676	fruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.
 17677	Dogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.
 17678	
 17679	He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes
 17680	walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took
 17681	out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.
 17682	
 17683	Where is that child's funeral disappeared to?
 17684	
 17685	A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,
 17686	dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a
 17687	granite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.
 17688	
 17689	Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it
 17690	with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing
 17691	on a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here
 17692	every day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount
 17693	Jerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every
 17694	minute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands
 17695	every hour. Too many in the world.
 17696	
 17697	Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy,
 17698	hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl's face stained with dirt
 17699	and tears, holding the woman's arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.
 17700	Fish's face, bloodless and livid.
 17701	
 17702	The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So
 17703	much dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First
 17704	the stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the
 17705	boy followed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the
 17706	brother-in-law.
 17707	
 17708	All walked after.
 17709	
 17710	Martin Cunningham whispered:
 17711	
 17712	--I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.
 17713	
 17714	--What? Mr Power whispered. How so?
 17715	
 17716	--His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the
 17717	Queen's hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.
 17718	Anniversary.
 17719	
 17720	--O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?
 17721	
 17722	He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed
 17723	towards the cardinal's mausoleum. Speaking.
 17724	
 17725	--Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.
 17726	
 17727	--I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily
 17728	mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.
 17729	
 17730	--How many children did he leave?
 17731	
 17732	--Five. Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into Todd's.
 17733	
 17734	--A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.
 17735	
 17736	--A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.
 17737	
 17738	--Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.
 17739	
 17740	Has the laugh at him now.
 17741	
 17742	He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had
 17743	outlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must
 17744	outlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the
 17745	world. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow
 17746	him. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who
 17747	knows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on
 17748	a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But
 17749	in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of
 17750	hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the
 17751	substance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,
 17752	waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and
 17753	lie no more in her warm bed.
 17754	
 17755	--How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven't
 17756	seen you for a month of Sundays.
 17757	
 17758	--Never better. How are all in Cork's own town?
 17759	
 17760	--I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert
 17761	said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.
 17762	
 17763	--And how is Dick, the solid man?
 17764	
 17765	--Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.
 17766	
 17767	--By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?
 17768	
 17769	--Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,
 17770	pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the
 17771	insurance is cleared up.
 17772	
 17773	--Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?
 17774	
 17775	--Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife's brother. John Henry Menton is
 17776	behind. He put down his name for a quid.
 17777	
 17778	--I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought
 17779	to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.
 17780	
 17781	--How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?
 17782	
 17783	--Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.
 17784	
 17785	They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind
 17786	the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the
 17787	slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there
 17788	when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment
 17789	and recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe three
 17790	shillings to O'Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin
 17791	into the chapel. Which end is his head?
 17792	
 17793	After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened
 17794	light. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow
 17795	candles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a
 17796	wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners
 17797	knelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the
 17798	font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper
 17799	from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black
 17800	hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.
 17801	
 17802	A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a
 17803	door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one
 17804	hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad's belly.
 17805	Who'll read the book? I, said the rook.
 17806	
 17807	They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book
 17808	with a fluent croak.
 17809	
 17810	Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. _Domine-namine._ Bully
 17811	about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe
 17812	betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst
 17813	sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on
 17814	him like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn:
 17815	burst sideways.
 17816	
 17817	_--Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine._
 17818	
 17819	Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem mass.
 17820	Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist. Chilly
 17821	place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the
 17822	gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toad too.
 17823	What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of
 17824	the place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot
 17825	of bad gas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they get like raw
 17826	beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the vaults of
 17827	saint Werburgh's lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a
 17828	hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it
 17829	rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you're a goner.
 17830	
 17831	My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That's better.
 17832	
 17833	The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's
 17834	bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and
 17835	shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you
 17836	were before you rested. It's all written down: he has to do it.
 17837	
 17838	_--Et ne nos inducas in tentationem._
 17839	
 17840	The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be
 17841	better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course
 17842	...
 17843	
 17844	Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed
 17845	up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.
 17846	What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal
 17847	day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in
 17848	childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls
 17849	with little sparrows' breasts. All the year round he prayed the same
 17850	thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam
 17851	now.
 17852	
 17853	_--In paradisum._
 17854	
 17855	Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over
 17856	everybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.
 17857	
 17858	The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny
 17859	Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
 17860	coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher
 17861	gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed
 17862	them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last
 17863	folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground
 17864	till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheels ground the
 17865	gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the
 17866	trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.
 17867	
 17868	The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn't lilt here.
 17869	
 17870	--The O'Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.
 17871	
 17872	Mr Power's soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.
 17873	
 17874	--He's at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. But
 17875	his heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here,
 17876	Simon!
 17877	
 17878	--Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I'll soon be stretched
 17879	beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.
 17880	
 17881	Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
 17882	in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.
 17883	
 17884	--She's better where she is, he said kindly.
 17885	
 17886	--I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in
 17887	heaven if there is a heaven.
 17888	
 17889	Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to
 17890	plod by.
 17891	
 17892	--Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.
 17893	
 17894	Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.
 17895	
 17896	--The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can
 17897	do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.
 17898	
 17899	They covered their heads.
 17900	
 17901	--The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don't you think?
 17902	Mr Kernan said with reproof.
 17903	
 17904	Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret
 17905	eyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We
 17906	are the last. In the same boat. Hope he'll say something else.
 17907	
 17908	Mr Kernan added:
 17909	
 17910	--The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more
 17911	impressive I must say.
 17912	
 17913	Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.
 17914	
 17915	Mr Kernan said with solemnity:
 17916	
 17917	--_I am the resurrection and the life_. That touches a man's inmost
 17918	heart.
 17919	
 17920	--It does, Mr Bloom said.
 17921	
 17922	Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two
 17923	with his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections.
 17924	Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood
 17925	every day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of
 17926	them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn
 17927	the thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are
 17928	dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come
 17929	forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day!
 17930	Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the
 17931	rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of
 17932	powder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.
 17933	
 17934	Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.
 17935	
 17936	--Everything went off A1, he said. What?
 17937	
 17938	He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman's shoulders. With
 17939	your tooraloom tooraloom.
 17940	
 17941	--As it should be, Mr Kernan said.
 17942	
 17943	--What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.
 17944	
 17945	Mr Kernan assured him.
 17946	
 17947	--Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I
 17948	know his face.
 17949	
 17950	Ned Lambert glanced back.
 17951	
 17952	--Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the
 17953	soprano. She's his wife.
 17954	
 17955	--O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven't seen her for some
 17956	time. He was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen
 17957	seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's in Roundtown. And a good
 17958	armful she was.
 17959	
 17960	He looked behind through the others.
 17961	
 17962	--What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn't he in the stationery
 17963	line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.
 17964	
 17965	Ned Lambert smiled.
 17966	
 17967	--Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely's. A traveller for blottingpaper.
 17968	
 17969	--In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like
 17970	that for? She had plenty of game in her then.
 17971	
 17972	--Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.
 17973	
 17974	John Henry Menton's large eyes stared ahead.
 17975	
 17976	The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the
 17977	grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.
 17978	
 17979	--John O'Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.
 17980	
 17981	Mr O'Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:
 17982	
 17983	--I am come to pay you another visit.
 17984	
 17985	--My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don't want
 17986	your custom at all.
 17987	
 17988	Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
 17989	Cunningham's side puzzling two long keys at his back.
 17990	
 17991	--Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?
 17992	
 17993	--I did not, Martin Cunningham said.
 17994	
 17995	They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The
 17996	caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke
 17997	in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.
 17998	
 17999	--They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy
 18000	evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for
 18001	Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After
 18002	traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the
 18003	drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking
 18004	up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.
 18005	
 18006	The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He
 18007	resumed:
 18008	
 18009	--And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like
 18010	the man_, says he. _That's not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.
 18011	
 18012	Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting
 18013	the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.
 18014	
 18015	--That's all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.
 18016	
 18017	--I know, Hynes said. I know that.
 18018	
 18019	--To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It's pure
 18020	goodheartedness: damn the thing else.
 18021	
 18022	Mr Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk. All want to be on good
 18023	terms with him. Decent fellow, John O'Connell, real good sort. Keys:
 18024	like Keyes's ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout checks.
 18025	_Habeas corpus_. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I
 18026	write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me
 18027	writing to Martha? Hope it's not chucked in the dead letter office. Be
 18028	the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That's the first sign when
 18029	the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross. Silver threads among
 18030	the grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the gumption to propose to
 18031	any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her. It
 18032	might thrill her first. Courting death... Shades of night hovering
 18033	here with all the dead stretched about. The shadows of the tombs when
 18034	churchyards yawn and Daniel O'Connell must be a descendant I suppose
 18035	who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the
 18036	same like a big giant in the dark. Will o' the wisp. Gas of graves.
 18037	Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all. Women especially are so
 18038	touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever
 18039	seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a pitchdark night. The clock was on
 18040	the stroke of twelve. Still they'd kiss all right if properly keyed up.
 18041	Whores in Turkish graveyards. Learn anything if taken young. You might
 18042	pick up a young widow here. Men like that. Love among the tombstones.
 18043	Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In the midst of death we are in life. Both
 18044	ends meet. Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to
 18045	the starving. Gnawing their vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting
 18046	to do it at the window. Eight children he has anyway.
 18047	
 18048	He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field
 18049	after field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing.
 18050	Sitting or kneeling you couldn't. Standing? His head might come up some
 18051	day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed
 18052	the ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim
 18053	grass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well,
 18054	so it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant
 18055	poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic
 18056	Gardens are just over there. It's the blood sinking in the earth gives
 18057	new life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. Every
 18058	man his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable
 18059	for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor
 18060	and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six. With
 18061	thanks.
 18062	
 18063	I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,
 18064	nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot
 18065	quick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowy
 18066	kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of
 18067	them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they
 18068	are go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically. Nothing to
 18069	feed on feed on themselves.
 18070	
 18071	But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply
 18072	swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little
 18073	seaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of
 18074	power seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at life.
 18075	Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one about
 18076	the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11 p.m.
 18077	(closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the men
 18078	anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's in
 18079	fashion. A juicy pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep
 18080	out the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.
 18081	Gravediggers in _Hamlet_. Shows the profound knowledge of the human
 18082	heart. Daren't joke about the dead for two years at least. _De mortuis
 18083	nil nisi prius_. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral.
 18084	Seems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live
 18085	longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.
 18086	
 18087	--How many have-you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.
 18088	
 18089	--Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.
 18090	
 18091	The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to
 18092	trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping
 18093	with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its
 18094	nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.
 18095	
 18096	Burying him. We come to bury Caesar. His ides of March or June. He
 18097	doesn't know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot
 18098	over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I'd like to know? Now I'd
 18099	give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never
 18100	dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he
 18101	could. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though he
 18102	could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too. First
 18103	thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to
 18104	life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you
 18105	come to look at it.
 18106	
 18107	     _O, poor Robinson Crusoe!
 18108	     How could you possibly do so?_
 18109	
 18110	Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of
 18111	them all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could
 18112	invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that
 18113	way. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow's.
 18114	They're so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from
 18115	the holy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one
 18116	coffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible
 18117	even in the earth. The Irishman's house is his coffin. Embalming in
 18118	catacombs, mummies the same idea.
 18119	
 18120	Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.
 18121	Twelve. I'm thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death's
 18122	number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn't in the chapel, that
 18123	I'll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.
 18124	
 18125	Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had
 18126	one like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he was
 18127	once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit
 18128	of mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It's dyed. His wife I forgot he's not
 18129	married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.
 18130	
 18131	The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the
 18132	gravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.
 18133	
 18134	Pause.
 18135	
 18136	If we were all suddenly somebody else.
 18137	
 18138	Far away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they
 18139	say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.
 18140	
 18141	Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The
 18142	boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in
 18143	the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.
 18144	Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.
 18145	Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It's the moment you feel. Must be
 18146	damned unpleasant. Can't believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone
 18147	else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I haven't yet. Then
 18148	darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Would you
 18149	like to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all you hid
 18150	all your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press his
 18151	lower eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the
 18152	soles of his feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the
 18153	floor since he's doomed. Devil in that picture of sinner's death showing
 18154	him a woman. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of _Lucia.
 18155	Shall i nevermore behold thee_? Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People
 18156	talk about you a bit: forget you. Don't forget to pray for him. Remember
 18157	him in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow:
 18158	dropping into a hole, one after the other.
 18159	
 18160	We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you're well and
 18161	not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the
 18162	fire of purgatory.
 18163	
 18164	Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when
 18165	you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy's warning. Near
 18166	you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma, poor
 18167	mamma, and little Rudy.
 18168	
 18169	The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in
 18170	on the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all
 18171	the time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of
 18172	course. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have
 18173	some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or
 18174	a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of
 18175	distress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well
 18176	to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there's no.
 18177	
 18178	The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.
 18179	
 18180	The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of
 18181	it. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves
 18182	without show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its
 18183	way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he
 18184	traversed the dismal fields.
 18185	
 18186	Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he
 18187	knows them all. No: coming to me.
 18188	
 18189	--I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your
 18190	christian name? I'm not sure.
 18191	
 18192	--L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M'Coy's name too. He
 18193	asked me to.
 18194	
 18195	--Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the _Freeman_ once.
 18196	
 18197	So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good
 18198	idea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know.
 18199	He died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads.
 18200	Charley, you're my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does
 18201	no harm. I saw to that, M'Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave him
 18202	under an obligation: costs nothing.
 18203	
 18204	--And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was
 18205	over there in the...
 18206	
 18207	He looked around.
 18208	
 18209	--Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?
 18210	
 18211	--M'Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don't know who he is. Is that his
 18212	name?
 18213	
 18214	He moved away, looking about him.
 18215	
 18216	--No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!
 18217	
 18218	Didn't hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all
 18219	the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good
 18220	Lord, what became of him?
 18221	
 18222	A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.
 18223	
 18224	--O, excuse me!
 18225	
 18226	He stepped aside nimbly.
 18227	
 18228	Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.
 18229	A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their
 18230	spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped
 18231	his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The
 18232	gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards
 18233	the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent
 18234	to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates,
 18235	walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.
 18236	Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord.
 18237	The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.
 18238	Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For
 18239	yourselves just.
 18240	
 18241	The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at
 18242	whiles to read a name on a tomb.
 18243	
 18244	--Let us go round by the chief's grave, Hynes said. We have time.
 18245	
 18246	--Let us, Mr Power said.
 18247	
 18248	They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr
 18249	Power's blank voice spoke:
 18250	
 18251	--Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled
 18252	with stones. That one day he will come again.
 18253	
 18254	Hynes shook his head.
 18255	
 18256	--Parnell will never come again, he said. He's there, all that was
 18257	mortal of him. Peace to his ashes.
 18258	
 18259	Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,
 18260	broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,
 18261	old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some
 18262	charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody
 18263	really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot. Then
 18264	lump them together to save time. All souls' day. Twentyseventh I'll be
 18265	at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free of weeds.
 18266	Old man himself. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Near death's
 18267	door. Who passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did it of
 18268	their own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the
 18269	bucket. More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So,
 18270	wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the
 18271	pound. Or a woman's with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew.
 18272	Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it
 18273	Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it.
 18274	Old Dr Murren's. The great physician called him home. Well it's God's
 18275	acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly plastered and painted.
 18276	Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church Times._ Marriage
 18277	ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of
 18278	bronzefoil. Better value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more
 18279	poetical. The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses
 18280	nothing. Immortelles.
 18281	
 18282	A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the
 18283	wedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him.
 18284	Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder.
 18285	Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a
 18286	daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.
 18287	
 18288	The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be
 18289	sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was
 18290	dedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this
 18291	infliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket
 18292	of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the
 18293	boy. Apollo that was.
 18294	
 18295	How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed. As
 18296	you are now so once were we.
 18297	
 18298	Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the
 18299	voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in
 18300	the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather.
 18301	Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain
 18302	hellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph
 18303	reminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn't remember the face after
 18304	fifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that died
 18305	when I was in Wisdom Hely's.
 18306	
 18307	Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!
 18308	
 18309	He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he
 18310	goes.
 18311	
 18312	An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the
 18313	pebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey
 18314	alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.
 18315	Good hidingplace for treasure.
 18316	
 18317	Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was
 18318	buried here by torchlight, wasn't he? Making his rounds.
 18319	
 18320	Tail gone now.
 18321	
 18322	One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones
 18323	clean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat
 18324	gone bad. Well and what's cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that
 18325	_Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a
 18326	corpse. Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the
 18327	other firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the
 18328	plague. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to ashes.
 18329	Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by birds.
 18330	Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See your whole
 18331	life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can't bury in the
 18332	air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news go about
 18333	whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication. We learned
 18334	that from them. Wouldn't be surprised. Regular square feed for them.
 18335	Flies come before he's well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They wouldn't care
 18336	about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste
 18337	like raw white turnips.
 18338	
 18339	The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again.
 18340	Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I
 18341	was here was Mrs Sinico's funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills.
 18342	And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case
 18343	I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running
 18344	gravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after
 18345	death. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after
 18346	death. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like that
 18347	other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel
 18348	yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty
 18349	beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm
 18350	fullblooded life.
 18351	
 18352	Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.
 18353	
 18354	Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,
 18355	commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office.
 18356	Mat Dillon's long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars,
 18357	the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out
 18358	that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke
 18359	of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate
 18360	at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree,
 18361	laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.
 18362	
 18363	Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.
 18364	
 18365	--Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.
 18366	
 18367	They stopped.
 18368	
 18369	--Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.
 18370	
 18371	John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.
 18372	
 18373	--There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also. John Henry Menton took
 18374	off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his
 18375	coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.
 18376	
 18377	--It's all right now, Martin Cunningham said.
 18378	
 18379	John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.
 18380	
 18381	--Thank you, he said shortly.
 18382	
 18383	They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind
 18384	a few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin
 18385	could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his
 18386	seeing it.
 18387	
 18388	Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.
 18389	Get the pull over him that way.
 18390	
 18391	Thank you. How grand we are this morning!
 18392	
 18393	
 18394	IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS
 18395	
 18396	
 18397	Before Nelson's pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started
 18398	for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure,
 18399	Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines,
 18400	Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold's Cross. The hoarse Dublin United
 18401	Tramway Company's timekeeper bawled them off:
 18402	
 18403	--Rathgar and Terenure!
 18404	
 18405	--Come on, Sandymount Green!
 18406	
 18407	Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck
 18408	moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.
 18409	
 18410	--Start, Palmerston Park!
 18411	
 18412	
 18413	THE WEARER OF THE CROWN
 18414	
 18415	
 18416	Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and
 18417	polished. Parked in North Prince's street His Majesty's vermilion
 18418	mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E. R., received
 18419	loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured
 18420	and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.
 18421	
 18422	GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS
 18423	
 18424	
 18425	Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince's stores
 18426	and bumped them up on the brewery float. On the brewery float bumped
 18427	dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince's
 18428	stores.
 18429	
 18430	--There it is, Red Murray said. Alexander Keyes.
 18431	
 18432	--Just cut it out, will you? Mr Bloom said, and I'll take it round to
 18433	the _Telegraph_ office.
 18434	
 18435	The door of Ruttledge's office creaked again. Davy Stephens, minute in a
 18436	large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with
 18437	a roll of papers under his cape, a king's courier.
 18438	
 18439	Red Murray's long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper
 18440	in four clean strokes. Scissors and paste.
 18441	
 18442	--I'll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut
 18443	square.
 18444	
 18445	--Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind
 18446	his ear, we can do him one.
 18447	
 18448	--Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. I'll rub that in.
 18449	
 18450	We.
 18451	
 18452	WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT
 18453	
 18454	
 18455	Red Murray touched Mr Bloom's arm with the shears and whispered:
 18456	
 18457	--Brayden.
 18458	
 18459	Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a
 18460	stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman
 18461	and National Press_ and the _Freeman's Journal and National Press_.
 18462	Dullthudding Guinness's barrels. It passed statelily up the staircase,
 18463	steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face. The broadcloth back
 18464	ascended each step: back. All his brains are in the nape of his neck,
 18465	Simon Dedalus says. Welts of flesh behind on him. Fat folds of neck,
 18466	fat, neck, fat, neck.
 18467	
 18468	--Don't you think his face is like Our Saviour? Red Murray whispered.
 18469	
 18470	The door of Ruttledge's office whispered: ee: cree. They always build
 18471	one door opposite another for the wind to. Way in. Way out.
 18472	
 18473	Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. Mary, Martha.
 18474	Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.
 18475	
 18476	--Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.
 18477	
 18478	--Yes, Red Murray agreed. But Mario was said to be the picture of Our
 18479	Saviour.
 18480	
 18481	Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs. Hand on his
 18482	heart. In _Martha._
 18483	
 18484	     _Co-ome thou lost one,
 18485	     Co-ome thou dear one!_
 18486	
 18487	THE CROZIER AND THE PEN
 18488	
 18489	
 18490	--His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.
 18491	
 18492	They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish. Neck.
 18493	
 18494	A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and
 18495	stepped off posthaste with a word:
 18496	
 18497	_--Freeman!_
 18498	
 18499	Mr Bloom said slowly:
 18500	
 18501	--Well, he is one of our saviours also.
 18502	
 18503	A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed
 18504	in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage,
 18505	along the now reverberating boards. But will he save the circulation?
 18506	Thumping. Thumping.
 18507	
 18508	He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn
 18509	packing paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards
 18510	Nannetti's reading closet.
 18511	
 18512	WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST
 18513	RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS
 18514	
 18515	
 18516	Hynes here too: account of the funeral probably. Thumping. Thump. This
 18517	morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines. Smash a man
 18518	to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. His machineries
 18519	are pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand: fermenting. Working
 18520	away, tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing to get in.
 18521	
 18522	HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT
 18523	
 18524	
 18525	Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman's spare body, admiring a glossy
 18526	crown.
 18527	
 18528	Strange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for
 18529	College green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was worth.
 18530	It's the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news in the
 18531	official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in the year
 18532	one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis, barony
 18533	of Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant to statute
 18534	showing return of number of mules and jennets exported from Ballina.
 18535	Nature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake's weekly Pat and Bull story. Uncle
 18536	Toby's page for tiny tots. Country bumpkin's queries. Dear Mr Editor,
 18537	what is a good cure for flatulence? I'd like that part. Learn a lot
 18538	teaching others. The personal note. M. A. P. Mainly all pictures.
 18539	Shapely bathers on golden strand. World's biggest balloon. Double
 18540	marriage of sisters celebrated. Two bridegrooms laughing heartily at
 18541	each other. Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than the Irish.
 18542	
 18543	The machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump. Now if he
 18544	got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they'd clank on and
 18545	on the same, print it over and over and up and back. Monkeydoodle the
 18546	whole thing. Want a cool head.
 18547	
 18548	--Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.
 18549	
 18550	Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.
 18551	
 18552	The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet
 18553	and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently over the
 18554	dirty glass screen.
 18555	
 18556	--Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.
 18557	
 18558	Mr Bloom stood in his way.
 18559	
 18560	--If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,
 18561	pointing backward with his thumb.
 18562	
 18563	--Did you? Hynes asked.
 18564	
 18565	--Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and you'll catch him.
 18566	
 18567	--Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I'll tap him too.
 18568	
 18569	He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman's Journal_.
 18570	
 18571	Three bob I lent him in Meagher's. Three weeks. Third hint.
 18572	
 18573	WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK
 18574	
 18575	
 18576	Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti's desk.
 18577	
 18578	--Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember?
 18579	
 18580	Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.
 18581	
 18582	--He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.
 18583	
 18584	The foreman moved his pencil towards it.
 18585	
 18586	--But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wants
 18587	two keys at the top.
 18588	
 18589	Hell of a racket they make. He doesn't hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves.
 18590	Maybe he understands what I.
 18591	
 18592	The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began
 18593	to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.
 18594	
 18595	--Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.
 18596	
 18597	Let him take that in first.
 18598	
 18599	Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the
 18600	foreman's sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the
 18601	obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles
 18602	of it unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels:
 18603	various uses, thousand and one things.
 18604	
 18605	Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew
 18606	swiftly on the scarred woodwork.
 18607	
 18608	HOUSE OF KEY(E)S
 18609	
 18610	
 18611	--Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name.
 18612	Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.
 18613	
 18614	Better not teach him his own business.
 18615	
 18616	--You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the top
 18617	in leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that's a good idea?
 18618	
 18619	The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched
 18620	there quietly.
 18621	
 18622	--The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor,
 18623	the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from the
 18624	isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?
 18625	
 18626	I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that _voglio._ But then
 18627	if he didn't know only make it awkward for him. Better not.
 18628	
 18629	--We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?
 18630	
 18631	--I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a
 18632	house there too. I'll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that
 18633	and just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass
 18634	licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.
 18635	
 18636	The foreman thought for an instant.
 18637	
 18638	--We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months' renewal.
 18639	
 18640	A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it
 18641	silently. Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching
 18642	the silent typesetters at their cases.
 18643	
 18644	ORTHOGRAPHICAL
 18645	
 18646	
 18647	Want to be sure of his spelling. Proof fever. Martin Cunningham forgot
 18648	to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning. It is amusing to view
 18649	the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess ment of a
 18650	harassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled pear
 18651	under a cemetery wall. Silly, isn't it? Cemetery put in of course on
 18652	account of the symmetry.
 18653	
 18654	I should have said when he clapped on his topper. Thank you. I ought
 18655	to have said something about an old hat or something. No. I could have
 18656	said. Looks as good as new now. See his phiz then.
 18657	
 18658	Sllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its
 18659	flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almost
 18660	human the way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak.
 18661	That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in its
 18662	own way. Sllt.
 18663	
 18664	NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR
 18665	
 18666	
 18667	The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:
 18668	
 18669	--Wait. Where's the archbishop's letter? It's to be repeated in the
 18670	_Telegraph._ Where's what's his name?
 18671	
 18672	He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.
 18673	
 18674	--Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox.
 18675	
 18676	--Ay. Where's Monks?
 18677	
 18678	--Monks!
 18679	
 18680	Mr Bloom took up his cutting. Time to get out.
 18681	
 18682	--Then I'll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you'll give it a
 18683	good place I know.
 18684	
 18685	--Monks!
 18686	
 18687	--Yes, sir.
 18688	
 18689	Three months' renewal. Want to get some wind off my chest first. Try it
 18690	anyhow. Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month. Ballsbridge. Tourists
 18691	over for the show.
 18692	
 18693	A DAYFATHER
 18694	
 18695	
 18696	He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed, spectacled,
 18697	aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he must have put
 18698	through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs' ads, speeches,
 18699	divorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now. Sober
 18700	serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I'd say. Wife a good cook and
 18701	washer. Daughter working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, no damn
 18702	nonsense. AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER
 18703	
 18704	
 18705	He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.
 18706	Reads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some practice
 18707	that. mangiD kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards
 18708	with his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear, O dear!
 18709	All that long business about that brought us out of the land of Egypt
 18710	and into the house of bondage _Alleluia. Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu_.
 18711	No, that's the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob's sons. And then
 18712	the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the
 18713	butcher. And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the
 18714	ox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look
 18715	into it well. Justice it means but it's everybody eating everyone else.
 18716	That's what life is after all. How quickly he does that job. Practice
 18717	makes perfect. Seems to see with his fingers.
 18718	
 18719	Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to
 18720	the landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch
 18721	him out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as
 18722	Citron's house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.
 18723	
 18724	ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP
 18725	
 18726	
 18727	He went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over those
 18728	walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy
 18729	smell there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom's next door
 18730	when I was there.
 18731	
 18732	He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap
 18733	I put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his handkerchief
 18734	he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket
 18735	of his trousers.
 18736	
 18737	What perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram: something
 18738	I forgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.
 18739	
 18740	A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.
 18741	Know who that is. What's up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert it
 18742	is.
 18743	
 18744	He entered softly.
 18745	
 18746	ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA
 18747	
 18748	
 18749	--The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to
 18750	the dusty windowpane.
 18751	
 18752	Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert's quizzing
 18753	face, asked of it sourly:
 18754	
 18755	--Agonising Christ, wouldn't it give you a heartburn on your arse?
 18756	
 18757	Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:
 18758	
 18759	--_Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles
 18760	on its way, tho' quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling
 18761	waters of Neptune's blue domain, 'mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest
 18762	zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or 'neath the shadows cast
 18763	o'er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of
 18764	the forest_. What about that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his
 18765	newspaper. How's that for high?
 18766	
 18767	--Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.
 18768	
 18769	Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:
 18770	
 18771	--_The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_. O boys! O boys!
 18772	
 18773	--And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on
 18774	the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.
 18775	
 18776	--That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I don't want to
 18777	hear any more of the stuff.
 18778	
 18779	He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,
 18780	hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.
 18781	
 18782	High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.
 18783	Rather upsets a man's day, a funeral does. He has influence they
 18784	say. Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his
 18785	greatgranduncle. Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death
 18786	written this long time perhaps. Living to spite them. Might go first
 18787	himself. Johnny, make room for your uncle. The right honourable Hedges
 18788	Eyre Chatterton. Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on
 18789	gale days. Windfall when he kicks out. Alleluia.
 18790	
 18791	--Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.
 18792	
 18793	--What is it? Mr Bloom asked.
 18794	
 18795	--A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered
 18796	with pomp of tone. _Our lovely land_. SHORT BUT TO THE POINT
 18797	
 18798	
 18799	--Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply.
 18800	
 18801	--Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. With an
 18802	accent on the whose.
 18803	
 18804	--Dan Dawson's land Mr Dedalus said.
 18805	
 18806	--Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.
 18807	
 18808	Ned Lambert nodded.
 18809	
 18810	--But listen to this, he said.
 18811	
 18812	The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was
 18813	pushed in.
 18814	
 18815	--Excuse me, J. J. O'Molloy said, entering.
 18816	
 18817	Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.
 18818	
 18819	--I beg yours, he said.
 18820	
 18821	--Good day, Jack.
 18822	
 18823	--Come in. Come in.
 18824	
 18825	--Good day.
 18826	
 18827	--How are you, Dedalus?
 18828	
 18829	--Well. And yourself?
 18830	
 18831	J. J. O'Molloy shook his head.
 18832	
 18833	SAD
 18834	
 18835	
 18836	Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. Decline, poor chap.
 18837	That hectic flush spells finis for a man. Touch and go with him. What's
 18838	in the wind, I wonder. Money worry.
 18839	
 18840	--_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks._
 18841	
 18842	--You're looking extra.
 18843	
 18844	--Is the editor to be seen? J. J. O'Molloy asked, looking towards the
 18845	inner door.
 18846	
 18847	--Very much so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. He's in
 18848	his sanctum with Lenehan.
 18849	
 18850	J. J. O'Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the
 18851	pink pages of the file.
 18852	
 18853	Practice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. Debts of
 18854	honour. Reaping the whirlwind. Used to get good retainers from D. and T.
 18855	Fitzgerald. Their wigs to show the grey matter. Brains on their sleeve
 18856	like the statue in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work for the
 18857	_Express_ with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford began
 18858	on the _Independent._ Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when
 18859	they get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold in the same
 18860	breath. Wouldn't know which to believe. One story good till you hear
 18861	the next. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows
 18862	over. Hail fellow well met the next moment.
 18863	
 18864	--Ah, listen to this for God' sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. _Or again if we
 18865	but climb the serried mountain peaks..._
 18866	
 18867	--Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Enough of the inflated
 18868	windbag!
 18869	
 18870	--_Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our
 18871	souls, as it were..._
 18872	
 18873	--Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is he
 18874	taking anything for it?
 18875	
 18876	_--As 'twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland's portfolio,
 18877	unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize
 18878	regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and
 18879	luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent
 18880	translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight..._
 18881	
 18882	HIS NATIVE DORIC
 18883	
 18884	
 18885	--The moon, professor MacHugh said. He forgot Hamlet.
 18886	
 18887	_--That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of
 18888	the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence..._
 18889	
 18890	--O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. Shite and
 18891	onions! That'll do, Ned. Life is too short.
 18892	
 18893	He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy
 18894	moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.
 18895	
 18896	Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An
 18897	instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh's
 18898	unshaven blackspectacled face.
 18899	
 18900	--Doughy Daw! he cried.
 18901	
 18902	WHAT WETHERUP SAID
 18903	
 18904	
 18905	All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot
 18906	cake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasn't he? Why they call
 18907	him Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged to that
 18908	chap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that nicely.
 18909	Entertainments. Open house. Big blowout. Wetherup always said that. Get
 18910	a grip of them by the stomach.
 18911	
 18912	The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested
 18913	by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared
 18914	about them and the harsh voice asked:
 18915	
 18916	--What is it?
 18917	
 18918	--And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said
 18919	grandly.
 18920	
 18921	--Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.
 18922	
 18923	--Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink
 18924	after that.
 18925	
 18926	--Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.
 18927	
 18928	--Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.
 18929	
 18930	Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor's blue eyes roved
 18931	towards Mr Bloom's face, shadowed by a smile.
 18932	
 18933	--Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.
 18934	
 18935	MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED
 18936	
 18937	
 18938	--North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. We
 18939	won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!
 18940	
 18941	--Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at
 18942	his toecaps.
 18943	
 18944	--In Ohio! the editor shouted.
 18945	
 18946	--So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.
 18947	
 18948	Passing out he whispered to J. J. O'Molloy:
 18949	
 18950	--Incipient jigs. Sad case.
 18951	
 18952	--Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.
 18953	My Ohio!
 18954	
 18955	--A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.
 18956	
 18957	O, HARP EOLIAN!
 18958	
 18959	
 18960	He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking
 18961	off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant
 18962	unwashed teeth.
 18963	
 18964	--Bingbang, bangbang.
 18965	
 18966	Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.
 18967	
 18968	--Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.
 18969	
 18970	He went in.
 18971	
 18972	--What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming
 18973	to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.
 18974	
 18975	--That'll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret.
 18976	Hello, Jack. That's all right.
 18977	
 18978	--Good day, Myles, J. J. O'Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip
 18979	limply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?
 18980	
 18981	The telephone whirred inside.
 18982	
 18983	--Twentyeight... No, twenty... Double four... Yes.
 18984	
 18985	SPOT THE WINNER
 18986	
 18987	
 18988	Lenehan came out of the inner office with SPORT'S tissues.
 18989	
 18990	--Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O.
 18991	Madden up.
 18992	
 18993	He tossed the tissues on to the table.
 18994	
 18995	Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was
 18996	flung open.
 18997	
 18998	--Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.
 18999	
 19000	Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin
 19001	by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the
 19002	steps. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air
 19003	blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.
 19004	
 19005	--It wasn't me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.
 19006	
 19007	--Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There's a hurricane
 19008	blowing.
 19009	
 19010	Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he
 19011	stooped twice.
 19012	
 19013	--Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat
 19014	Farrell shoved me, sir.
 19015	
 19016	He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.
 19017	
 19018	--Him, sir.
 19019	
 19020	--Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.
 19021	
 19022	He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.
 19023	
 19024	J. J. O'Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:
 19025	
 19026	--Continued on page six, column four.
 19027	
 19028	--Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.
 19029	Is the boss...? Yes, _Telegraph_... To where? Aha! Which auction rooms
 19030	?... Aha! I see... Right. I'll catch him.
 19031	
 19032	A COLLISION ENSUES
 19033	
 19034	
 19035	The bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped
 19036	against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.
 19037	
 19038	--_Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and
 19039	making a grimace.
 19040	
 19041	--My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I'm in a
 19042	hurry.
 19043	
 19044	--Knee, Lenehan said.
 19045	
 19046	He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:
 19047	
 19048	--The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.
 19049	
 19050	--Sorry, Mr Bloom said.
 19051	
 19052	He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O'Molloy slapped
 19053	the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan,
 19054	echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:
 19055	
 19056	     _--We are the boys of Wexford
 19057	     Who fought with heart and hand._
 19058	
 19059	EXIT BLOOM
 19060	
 19061	
 19062	--I'm just running round to Bachelor's walk, Mr Bloom said, about this
 19063	ad of Keyes's. Want to fix it up. They tell me he's round there in
 19064	Dillon's.
 19065	
 19066	He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,
 19067	leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,
 19068	suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.
 19069	
 19070	--Begone! he said. The world is before you.
 19071	
 19072	--Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.
 19073	
 19074	J. J. O'Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan's hand and read them,
 19075	blowing them apart gently, without comment.
 19076	
 19077	--He'll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his
 19078	blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps
 19079	after him.
 19080	
 19081	--Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.
 19082	
 19083	A STREET CORTEGE
 19084	
 19085	
 19086	Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr
 19087	Bloom's wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a
 19088	tail of white bowknots.
 19089	
 19090	--Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said,
 19091	and you'll kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the
 19092	walk. Small nines. Steal upon larks.
 19093	
 19094	He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding
 19095	feet past the fireplace to J. J. O'Molloy who placed the tissues in his
 19096	receiving hands.
 19097	
 19098	--What's that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other two
 19099	gone?
 19100	
 19101	--Who? the professor said, turning. They're gone round to the Oval for a
 19102	drink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.
 19103	
 19104	--Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where's my hat?
 19105	
 19106	He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his
 19107	jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the
 19108	air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.
 19109	
 19110	--He's pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.
 19111	
 19112	--Seems to be, J. J. O'Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in
 19113	murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the most
 19114	matches?
 19115	
 19116	THE CALUMET OF PEACE
 19117	
 19118	
 19119	He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan
 19120	promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J. J.
 19121	O'Molloy opened his case again and offered it.
 19122	
 19123	--_Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.
 19124	
 19125	The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. He
 19126	declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:
 19127	
 19128	_--'Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, 'Twas empire charmed thy
 19129	heart._
 19130	
 19131	The professor grinned, locking his long lips.
 19132	
 19133	--Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.
 19134	
 19135	He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him
 19136	with quick grace, said:
 19137	
 19138	--Silence for my brandnew riddle!
 19139	
 19140	--_Imperium romanum_, J. J. O'Molloy said gently. It sounds nobler than
 19141	British or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.
 19142	
 19143	Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.
 19144	
 19145	--That's it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire.
 19146	We haven't got the chance of a snowball in hell.
 19147	
 19148	THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME
 19149	
 19150	
 19151	--Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. We
 19152	mustn't be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome,
 19153	imperial, imperious, imperative.
 19154	
 19155	He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:
 19156	
 19157	--What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers.
 19158	The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet
 19159	to be here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah_. The Roman, like the
 19160	Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on
 19161	which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal
 19162	obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to be
 19163	here. Let us construct a watercloset._
 19164	
 19165	--Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient
 19166	ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness's, were partial
 19167	to the running stream.
 19168	
 19169	--They were nature's gentlemen, J. J. O'Molloy murmured. But we have
 19170	also Roman law.
 19171	
 19172	--And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.
 19173	
 19174	--Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. O'Molloy asked.
 19175	It was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going swimmingly
 19176	...
 19177	
 19178	--First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?
 19179	
 19180	Mr O'Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from
 19181	the hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.
 19182	
 19183	--_Entrez, mes enfants!_ Lenehan cried.
 19184	
 19185	--I escort a suppliant, Mr O'Madden Burke said melodiously. Youth led by
 19186	Experience visits Notoriety.
 19187	
 19188	--How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Your
 19189	governor is just gone.???
 19190	
 19191	
 19192	Lenehan said to all:
 19193	
 19194	--Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline? Reflect, ponder,
 19195	excogitate, reply.
 19196	
 19197	Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and
 19198	signature.
 19199	
 19200	--Who? the editor asked.
 19201	
 19202	Bit torn off.
 19203	
 19204	--Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.
 19205	
 19206	--That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken?
 19207	
 19208	     _On swift sail flaming
 19209	     From storm and south
 19210	     He comes, pale vampire,
 19211	     Mouth to my mouth._
 19212	
 19213	--Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their
 19214	shoulders. Foot and mouth? Are you turned...?
 19215	
 19216	Bullockbefriending bard.
 19217	
 19218	SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT
 19219	
 19220	
 19221	--Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. The letter is not mine. Mr
 19222	Garrett Deasy asked me to...
 19223	
 19224	--O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. The
 19225	bloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth
 19226	disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter's
 19227	face in the Star and Garter. Oho!
 19228	
 19229	A woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of
 19230	Menelaus, ten years the Greeks. O'Rourke, prince of Breffni.
 19231	
 19232	--Is he a widower? Stephen asked.
 19233	
 19234	--Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the
 19235	typescript. Emperor's horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on
 19236	the ramparts of Vienna. Don't you forget! Maximilian Karl O'Donnell,
 19237	graf von Tirconnell in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king
 19238	an Austrian fieldmarshal now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild
 19239	geese. O yes, every time. Don't you forget that!
 19240	
 19241	--The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. O'Molloy said quietly,
 19242	turning a horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thank you job.
 19243	
 19244	Professor MacHugh turned on him.
 19245	
 19246	--And if not? he said.
 19247	
 19248	--I'll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. A Hungarian it was one
 19249	day... LOST CAUSES
 19250	
 19251	NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED
 19252	
 19253	
 19254	--We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for
 19255	us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never
 19256	loyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin
 19257	language. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is
 19258	the maxim: time is money. Material domination. _Dominus!_ Lord! Where is
 19259	the spirituality? Lord Jesus? Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend club.
 19260	But the Greek!
 19261	
 19262	KYRIE ELEISON!
 19263	
 19264	
 19265	A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long
 19266	lips.
 19267	
 19268	--The Greek! he said again. _Kyrios!_ Shining word! The vowels the
 19269	Semite and the Saxon know not. _Kyrie!_ The radiance of the intellect.
 19270	I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind. _Kyrie eleison!_ The
 19271	closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit. We
 19272	are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at
 19273	Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium,_ that
 19274	went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami. Yes, yes. They went
 19275	under. Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the
 19276	fortunes of Greece. Loyal to a lost cause.
 19277	
 19278	He strode away from them towards the window.
 19279	
 19280	--They went forth to battle, Mr O'Madden Burke said greyly, but they
 19281	always fell.
 19282	
 19283	--Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received in
 19284	the latter half of the _matinÃ©e_. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!
 19285	
 19286	He whispered then near Stephen's ear:
 19287	
 19288	LENEHAN'S LIMERICK
 19289	
 19290	
 19291	     _There's a ponderous pundit MacHugh
 19292	     Who wears goggles of ebony hue.
 19293	     As he mostly sees double
 19294	     To wear them why trouble?
 19295	     I can't see the Joe Miller. Can you?_
 19296	
 19297	In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.
 19298	
 19299	Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.
 19300	
 19301	--That'll be all right, he said. I'll read the rest after. That'll be
 19302	all right.
 19303	
 19304	Lenehan extended his hands in protest.
 19305	
 19306	--But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railwayline?
 19307	
 19308	--Opera? Mr O'Madden Burke's sphinx face reriddled.
 19309	
 19310	Lenehan announced gladly:
 19311	
 19312	--_The Rose of Castile_. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!
 19313	
 19314	He poked Mr O'Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O'Madden Burke fell
 19315	back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.
 19316	
 19317	--Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.
 19318	
 19319	Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling
 19320	tissues.
 19321	
 19322	The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across
 19323	Stephen's and Mr O'Madden Burke's loose ties.
 19324	
 19325	--Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.
 19326	
 19327	--Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. J. O'Molloy said in
 19328	quiet mockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between
 19329	you? You look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff.
 19330	
 19331	OMNIUM GATHERUM
 19332	
 19333	
 19334	--We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.
 19335	
 19336	--All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics...
 19337	
 19338	--The turf, Lenehan put in.
 19339	
 19340	--Literature, the press.
 19341	
 19342	--If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of
 19343	advertisement.
 19344	
 19345	--And Madam Bloom, Mr O'Madden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublin's
 19346	prime favourite.
 19347	
 19348	Lenehan gave a loud cough.
 19349	
 19350	--Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a
 19351	cold in the park. The gate was open.
 19352	
 19353	YOU CAN DO IT!
 19354	
 19355	
 19356	The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen's shoulder.
 19357	
 19358	--I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite
 19359	in it. You can do it. I see it in your face. _In the lexicon of youth_
 19360	...
 19361	
 19362	See it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.
 19363	
 19364	--Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Great
 19365	nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the
 19366	public! Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn
 19367	its soul. Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M'Carthy.
 19368	
 19369	--We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
 19370	
 19371	Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.
 19372	
 19373	--He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. O'Molloy said.
 19374	
 19375	THE GREAT GALLAHER
 19376	
 19377	
 19378	--You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in
 19379	emphasis. Wait a minute. We'll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher
 19380	used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the
 19381	Clarence. Gallaher, that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You
 19382	know how he made his mark? I'll tell you. That was the smartest piece of
 19383	journalism ever known. That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of
 19384	the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I
 19385	suppose. I'll show you.
 19386	
 19387	He pushed past them to the files.
 19388	
 19389	--Look at here, he said turning. The _New York World_ cabled for a
 19390	special. Remember that time?
 19391	
 19392	Professor MacHugh nodded.
 19393	
 19394	--_New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw
 19395	hat. Where it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Joe Brady and
 19396	the rest of them. Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Whole route, see?
 19397	
 19398	--Skin-the-Goat, Mr O'Madden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has that
 19399	cabman's shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me.
 19400	You know Holohan?
 19401	
 19402	--Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.
 19403	
 19404	--And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for
 19405	the corporation. A night watchman.
 19406	
 19407	Stephen turned in surprise.
 19408	
 19409	--Gumley? he said. You don't say so? A friend of my father's, is it?
 19410	
 19411	--Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mind
 19412	the stones, see they don't run away. Look at here. What did Ignatius
 19413	Gallaher do? I'll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away.
 19414	Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?
 19415	
 19416	He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.
 19417	
 19418	--Take page four, advertisement for Bransome's coffee, let us say. Have
 19419	you got that? Right.
 19420	
 19421	The telephone whirred.
 19422	
 19423	A DISTANT VOICE
 19424	
 19425	
 19426	--I'll answer it, the professor said, going.
 19427	
 19428	--B is parkgate. Good.
 19429	
 19430	His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.
 19431	
 19432	--T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroon
 19433	gate.
 19434	
 19435	The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock's wattles. An illstarched
 19436	dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his
 19437	waistcoat.
 19438	
 19439	--Hello? _Evening Telegraph_ here... Hello?... Who's there?... Yes...
 19440	Yes... Yes.
 19441	
 19442	--F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi,
 19443	Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F.A.B.P.
 19444	Got that? X is Davy's publichouse in upper Leeson street.
 19445	
 19446	The professor came to the inner door.
 19447	
 19448	--Bloom is at the telephone, he said.
 19449	
 19450	--Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Davy's
 19451	publichouse, see? CLEVER, VERY
 19452	
 19453	
 19454	--Clever, Lenehan said. Very.
 19455	
 19456	--Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody
 19457	history.
 19458	
 19459	Nightmare from which you will never awake.
 19460	
 19461	--I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, the
 19462	besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and
 19463	myself.
 19464	
 19465	Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:
 19466	
 19467	--Madam, I'm Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.
 19468	
 19469	--History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Prince's street was
 19470	there first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of
 19471	an advertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the
 19472	leg up. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the _Star._
 19473	Now he's got in with Blumenfeld. That's press. That's talent. Pyatt! He
 19474	was all their daddies!
 19475	
 19476	--The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the
 19477	brother-in-law of Chris Callinan.
 19478	
 19479	--Hello?... Are you there?... Yes, he's here still. Come across
 19480	yourself.
 19481	
 19482	--Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried. He
 19483	flung the pages down.
 19484	
 19485	--Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O'Madden Burke.
 19486	
 19487	--Very smart, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
 19488	
 19489	Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.
 19490	
 19491	--Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers
 19492	were up before the recorder?
 19493	
 19494	--O yes, J. J. O'Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home
 19495	through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that
 19496	cyclone last year and thought she'd buy a view of Dublin. And it
 19497	turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or
 19498	Skin-the-Goat. Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!
 19499	
 19500	--They're only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.
 19501	Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those
 19502	fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O'Hagan.
 19503	Eh? Ah, bloody nonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.
 19504	
 19505	His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.
 19506	
 19507	Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why did you
 19508	write it then?
 19509	
 19510	RHYMES AND REASONS
 19511	
 19512	
 19513	Mouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth? Must be
 19514	some. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. Rhymes: two men dressed the same,
 19515	looking the same, two by two.
 19516	
 19517	     _........................ la tua pace
 19518	    .................. che parlar ti piace
 19519	    .... mentrechÃ© il vento, come fa, si tace._
 19520	
 19521	He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in
 19522	russet, entwining, _per l'aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella
 19523	pacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar fe piu ardenti._
 19524	But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth
 19525	south: tomb womb.
 19526	
 19527	--Speak up for yourself, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
 19528	
 19529	SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY...
 19530	
 19531	
 19532	J. J. O'Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.
 19533	
 19534	--My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false
 19535	construction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised, for
 19536	the third profession qua profession but your Cork legs are running away
 19537	with you. Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and
 19538	Edmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss,
 19539	Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery
 19540	guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly's Budget, Pue's Occurrences_
 19541	and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_. Why bring in a master
 19542	of forensic eloquence like Whiteside? Sufficient for the day is the
 19543	newspaper thereof. LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE
 19544	
 19545	
 19546	--Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his
 19547	face. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established 1763. Dr Lucas.
 19548	Who have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!
 19549	
 19550	--Well, J. J. O'Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.
 19551	
 19552	--Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it
 19553	in his blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.
 19554	
 19555	--He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for
 19556	... But no matter.
 19557	
 19558	J. J. O'Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:
 19559	
 19560	--One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life
 19561	fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide,
 19562	the Childs murder case. Bushe defended him. _And in the porches of mine
 19563	ear did pour._
 19564	
 19565	
 19566	By the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the other
 19567	story, beast with two backs?
 19568	
 19569	--What was that? the professor asked.
 19570	
 19571	ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM
 19572	
 19573	
 19574	--He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. O'Molloy said, of Roman justice
 19575	as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_. And he
 19576	cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.
 19577	
 19578	--Ha.
 19579	
 19580	--A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!
 19581	
 19582	Pause. J. J. O'Molloy took out his cigarettecase.
 19583	
 19584	False lull. Something quite ordinary.
 19585	
 19586	Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.
 19587	
 19588	I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that
 19589	it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,
 19590	that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives. A POLISHED
 19591	PERIOD
 19592	
 19593	
 19594	J. J. O'Molloy resumed, moulding his words:
 19595	
 19596	--He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and
 19597	terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and
 19598	of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor
 19599	has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring
 19600	deserves to live, deserves to live._
 19601	
 19602	His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.
 19603	
 19604	--Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.
 19605	
 19606	--The divine afflatus, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
 19607	
 19608	--You like it? J. J. O'Molloy asked Stephen.
 19609	
 19610	Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. He
 19611	took a cigarette from the case. J. J. O'Molloy offered his case to Myles
 19612	Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy,
 19613	saying:
 19614	
 19615	--Muchibus thankibus.
 19616	
 19617	A MAN OF HIGH MORALE
 19618	
 19619	
 19620	--Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O'Molloy said
 19621	to Stephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal
 19622	hush poets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it.
 19623	She was a nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee
 19624	interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to
 19625	ask him about planes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have
 19626	been pulling A. E.'s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale,
 19627	Magennis.
 19628	
 19629	Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say
 19630	about me? Don't ask.
 19631	
 19632	--No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.
 19633	Wait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I
 19634	ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical
 19635	society. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had
 19636	spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),
 19637	advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.
 19638	
 19639	He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:
 19640	
 19641	--You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his
 19642	discourse.
 19643	
 19644	--He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O'Molloy said, rumour has it, on
 19645	the Trinity college estates commission.
 19646	
 19647	--He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child's
 19648	frock. Go on. Well?
 19649	
 19650	--It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,
 19651	full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will
 19652	not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man's contumely
 19653	upon the new movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak,
 19654	therefore worthless.
 19655	
 19656	He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised
 19657	an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and
 19658	ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new
 19659	focus.
 19660	
 19661	IMPROMPTU
 19662	
 19663	
 19664	In ferial tone he addressed J. J. O'Molloy:
 19665	
 19666	--Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he
 19667	had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one
 19668	shorthandwriter in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy
 19669	beard round it. He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he
 19670	looked (though he was not) a dying man.
 19671	
 19672	His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O'Molloy's towards
 19673	Stephen's face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His
 19674	unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his
 19675	withering hair. Still seeking, he said:
 19676	
 19677	--When Fitzgibbon's speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.
 19678	Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.
 19679	
 19680	He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more.
 19681	Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.
 19682	
 19683	He began:
 19684	
 19685	_--Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in
 19686	listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment
 19687	since by my learned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported
 19688	into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from
 19689	this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the
 19690	speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses._
 19691	
 19692	His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes
 19693	ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. _And let our
 19694	crooked smokes._ Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand
 19695	at it yourself?
 19696	
 19697	_--And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian
 19698	highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard
 19699	his words and their meaning was revealed to me._
 19700	
 19701	FROM THE FATHERS
 19702	
 19703	
 19704	It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted
 19705	which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good
 19706	could be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That's saint Augustine.
 19707	
 19708	_--Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our
 19709	language? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. You
 19710	have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and
 19711	our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise
 19712	furrow the waters of the known globe. You have but emerged from
 19713	primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong
 19714	history and a polity._
 19715	
 19716	Nile.
 19717	
 19718	Child, man, effigy.
 19719	
 19720	By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple
 19721	in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.
 19722	
 19723	_--You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and
 19724	mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra.
 19725	Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Israel
 19726	is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her
 19727	arms. Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at
 19728	our name._
 19729	
 19730	A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it
 19731	boldly:
 19732	
 19733	_--But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and
 19734	accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will
 19735	and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have
 19736	brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed
 19737	the pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the
 19738	Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai's mountaintop nor ever have come down
 19739	with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in
 19740	his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw._
 19741	
 19742	He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.
 19743	
 19744	OMINOUS--FOR HIM!
 19745	
 19746	J. J. O'Molloy said not without regret:
 19747	
 19748	--And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.
 19749	
 19750	--A sudden--at--the--moment--though--from--lingering--illness--often--
 19751	previously--expectorated--demise, Lenehan added. And with a great future
 19752	behind him.
 19753	
 19754	The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering
 19755	up the staircase.
 19756	
 19757	--That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted. Gone with the
 19758	wind. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles of ears of
 19759	porches. The tribune's words, howled and scattered to the four winds.
 19760	A people sheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic records of all
 19761	that ever anywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me no more.
 19762	
 19763	I have money.
 19764	
 19765	--Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may I
 19766	suggest that the house do now adjourn?
 19767	
 19768	--You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment?
 19769	Mr O'Madden Burke asked. 'Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,
 19770	metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.
 19771	
 19772	--That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All that are in favour
 19773	say ay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To
 19774	which particular boosing shed?... My casting vote is: Mooney's!
 19775	
 19776	He led the way, admonishing:
 19777	
 19778	--We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? Yes,
 19779	we will not. By no manner of means.
 19780	
 19781	Mr O'Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally's lunge of his
 19782	umbrella:
 19783	
 19784	--Lay on, Macduff!
 19785	
 19786	--Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the
 19787	shoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?
 19788	
 19789	He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.
 19790	
 19791	--Foot and mouth. I know. That'll be all right. That'll go in. Where are
 19792	they? That's all right.
 19793	
 19794	He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office. LET US HOPE
 19795	
 19796	
 19797	J. J. O'Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:
 19798	
 19799	--I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.
 19800	
 19801	He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.
 19802	
 19803	--Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isn't it? It
 19804	has the prophetic vision. _Fuit Ilium!_ The sack of windy Troy. Kingdoms
 19805	of this world. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.
 19806	
 19807	The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and
 19808	rushed out into the street, yelling:
 19809	
 19810	--Racing special!
 19811	
 19812	Dublin. I have much, much to learn.
 19813	
 19814	They turned to the left along Abbey street.
 19815	
 19816	--I have a vision too, Stephen said.
 19817	
 19818	--Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford will
 19819	follow.
 19820	
 19821	Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:
 19822	
 19823	--Racing special!
 19824	
 19825	DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN
 19826	
 19827	
 19828	Dubliners.
 19829	
 19830	--Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty
 19831	and fiftythree years in Fumbally's lane.
 19832	
 19833	--Where is that? the professor asked.
 19834	
 19835	--Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.
 19836	
 19837	Damp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face glistering
 19838	tallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records. Quicker,
 19839	darlint!
 19840	
 19841	On now. Dare it. Let there be life.
 19842	
 19843	--They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson's pillar.
 19844	They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. They
 19845	shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies
 19846	with the blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven
 19847	in coppers. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their
 19848	umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.
 19849	
 19850	--Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.
 19851	
 19852	LIFE ON THE RAW
 19853	
 19854	
 19855	--They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at
 19856	the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins,
 19857	proprietress... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl
 19858	at the foot of Nelson's pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. They
 19859	give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin
 19860	to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each
 19861	other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the
 19862	brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down,
 19863	peeping at the airslits. Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that
 19864	high.
 19865	
 19866	Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the
 19867	lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got
 19868	a bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen
 19869	and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.
 19870	
 19871	--Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can
 19872	see them. What's keeping our friend?
 19873	
 19874	He turned.
 19875	
 19876	A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all
 19877	directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them
 19878	Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet
 19879	face, talking with J. J. O'Molloy.
 19880	
 19881	--Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.
 19882	
 19883	He set off again to walk by Stephen's side. RETURN OF BLOOM
 19884	
 19885	
 19886	--Yes, he said. I see them.
 19887	
 19888	Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the
 19889	offices of the _Irish Catholic and Dublin Penny Journal_, called:
 19890	
 19891	--Mr Crawford! A moment!
 19892	
 19893	--_Telegraph_! Racing special!
 19894	
 19895	--What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.
 19896	
 19897	A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom's face:
 19898	
 19899	--Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!
 19900	
 19901	INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR
 19902	
 19903	
 19904	--Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,
 19905	puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyes
 19906	just now. He'll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he'll
 19907	see. But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too,
 19908	the Saturday pink. And he wants it copied if it's not too late I told
 19909	councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_. I can have access to
 19910	it in the national library. House of keys, don't you see? His name is
 19911	Keyes. It's a play on the name. But he practically promised he'd give
 19912	the renewal. But he wants just a little puff. What will I tell him, Mr
 19913	Crawford? K.M.A.
 19914	
 19915	
 19916	--Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing
 19917	out his arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.
 19918	
 19919	A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm.
 19920	Lenehan's yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder is
 19921	that young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on him
 19922	today. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in
 19923	muck somewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?
 19924	
 19925	--Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I
 19926	suppose it's worth a short par. He'd give the ad, I think. I'll tell him
 19927	... K.M.R.I.A.
 19928	
 19929	
 19930	--He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his
 19931	shoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.
 19932	
 19933	While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on
 19934	jerkily.
 19935	
 19936	RAISING THE WIND
 19937	
 19938	
 19939	--_Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I'm up to
 19940	here. I've been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to
 19941	back a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take
 19942	the will for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind
 19943	anyhow.
 19944	
 19945	J. J. O'Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught up
 19946	on the others and walked abreast.
 19947	
 19948	--When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty
 19949	fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the
 19950	railings.
 19951	
 19952	--Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two old
 19953	Dublin women on the top of Nelson's pillar.
 19954	
 19955	SOME COLUMN!--THAT'S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID
 19956	
 19957	
 19958	--That's new, Myles Crawford said. That's copy. Out for the waxies
 19959	Dargle. Two old trickies, what?
 19960	
 19961	--But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see
 19962	the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines'
 19963	blue dome, Adam and Eve's, saint Laurence O'Toole's. But it makes them
 19964	giddy to look so they pull up their skirts...
 19965	
 19966	THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES
 19967	
 19968	
 19969	--Easy all, Myles Crawford said. No poetic licence. We're in the
 19970	archdiocese here.
 19971	
 19972	--And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue
 19973	of the onehandled adulterer.
 19974	
 19975	--Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the
 19976	idea. I see what you mean.
 19977	
 19978	DAMES DONATE DUBLIN'S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF
 19979	
 19980	
 19981	--It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too
 19982	tired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums between
 19983	them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with
 19984	their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and
 19985	spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.
 19986	
 19987	He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr O'Madden
 19988	Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney's.
 19989	
 19990	--Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse.
 19991	
 19992	SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS. SPARTANS GNASH
 19993	MOLARS. ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.
 19994	
 19995	
 19996	--You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of
 19997	Gorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he were
 19998	bitterer against others or against himself. He was the son of a noble
 19999	and a bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of
 20000	beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.
 20001	
 20002	Poor Penelope. Penelope Rich.
 20003	
 20004	They made ready to cross O'Connell street.
 20005	
 20006	HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!
 20007	
 20008	
 20009	At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless
 20010	trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines,
 20011	Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green, Ringsend
 20012	and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper Rathmines,
 20013	all still, becalmed in short circuit. Hackney cars, cabs, delivery
 20014	waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats with
 20015	rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly.
 20016	
 20017	WHAT?--AND LIKEWISE--WHERE?
 20018	
 20019	
 20020	--But what do you call it? Myles Crawford asked. Where did they get the
 20021	plums?
 20022	
 20023	VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE. SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.
 20024	
 20025	
 20026	--Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to
 20027	reflect. Call it, let me see. Call it: _deus nobis haec otia fecit._
 20028	
 20029	--No, Stephen said. I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or the
 20030	Parable of The Plums._
 20031	
 20032	--I see, the professor said.
 20033	
 20034	He laughed richly.
 20035	
 20036	--I see, he said again with new pleasure. Moses and the promised land.
 20037	We gave him that idea, he added to J. J. O'Molloy.
 20038	
 20039	HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY
 20040	
 20041	
 20042	J. J. O'Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held
 20043	his peace.
 20044	
 20045	--I see, the professor said.
 20046	
 20047	He halted on sir John Gray's pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson
 20048	through the meshes of his wry smile.

 20054	--Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. That tickles me, I must
 20055	say.
 20056	
 20057	--Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty's
 20058	truth was known.
 20059	
 20060	
 20061	Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch. A sugarsticky girl
 20062	shovelling scoopfuls of creams for a christian brother. Some school
 20063	treat. Bad for their tummies. Lozenge and comfit manufacturer to His
 20064	Majesty the King. God. Save. Our. Sitting on his throne sucking red
 20065	jujubes white.
 20066	
 20067	
 20068	A sombre Y.M.C.A. young man, watchful among the warm sweet fumes of
 20069	Graham Lemon's, placed a throwaway in a hand of Mr Bloom.
 20070	
 20071	Heart to heart talks.
 20072	
 20073	Bloo... Me? No.
 20074	
 20075	Blood of the Lamb.
 20076	
 20077	His slow feet walked him riverward, reading. Are you saved? All are
 20078	washed in the blood of the lamb. God wants blood victim. Birth, hymen,
 20079	martyr, war, foundation of a building, sacrifice, kidney burntoffering,
 20080	druids' altars. Elijah is coming. Dr John Alexander Dowie restorer of
 20081	the church in Zion is coming.
 20082	
 20083	_Is coming! Is coming!! Is coming!!! All heartily welcome._ Paying game.
 20084	Torry and Alexander last year. Polygamy. His wife will put the stopper
 20085	on that. Where was that ad some Birmingham firm the luminous crucifix.
 20086	Our Saviour. Wake up in the dead of night and see him on the wall,
 20087	hanging. Pepper's ghost idea. Iron nails ran in.
 20088	
 20089	
 20090	Phosphorus it must be done with. If you leave a bit of codfish for
 20091	instance. I could see the bluey silver over it. Night I went down to the
 20092	pantry in the kitchen. Don't like all the smells in it waiting to rush
 20093	out. What was it she wanted? The Malaga raisins. Thinking of Spain.
 20094	Before Rudy was born. The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny. Very good
 20095	for the brain.
 20096	
 20097	From Butler's monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor's walk.
 20098	Dedalus' daughter there still outside Dillon's auctionrooms. Must be
 20099	selling off some old furniture. Knew her eyes at once from the father.
 20100	Lobbing about waiting for him. Home always breaks up when the mother
 20101	goes. Fifteen children he had. Birth every year almost. That's in their
 20102	theology or the priest won't give the poor woman the confession, the
 20103	absolution. Increase and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? Eat
 20104	you out of house and home. No families themselves to feed. Living on the
 20105	fat of the land. Their butteries and larders. I'd like to see them do
 20106	the black fast Yom Kippur. Crossbuns. One meal and a collation for fear
 20107	he'd collapse on the altar. A housekeeper of one of those fellows if you
 20108	could pick it out of her. Never pick it out of her. Like getting l.s.d.
 20109	out of him. Does himself well. No guests. All for number one. Watching
 20110	his water. Bring your own bread and butter. His reverence: mum's the
 20111	word.
 20112	
 20113	Good Lord, that poor child's dress is in flitters. Underfed she looks
 20114	too. Potatoes and marge, marge and potatoes. It's after they feel it.
 20115	Proof of the pudding. Undermines the constitution.
 20116	
 20117	As he set foot on O'Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from
 20118	the parapet. Brewery barge with export stout. England. Sea air sours it,
 20119	I heard. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see the
 20120	brewery. Regular world in itself. Vats of porter wonderful. Rats get in
 20121	too. Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Dead drunk on
 20122	the porter. Drink till they puke again like christians. Imagine drinking
 20123	that! Rats: vats. Well, of course, if we knew all the things.
 20124	
 20125	Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt
 20126	quaywalls, gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben
 20127	J's son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and
 20128	eightpence too much. Hhhhm. It's the droll way he comes out with the
 20129	things. Knows how to tell a story too.
 20130	
 20131	They wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.
 20132	
 20133	He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet
 20134	per sec is com. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of
 20135	swells, floated under by the bridgepiers. Not such damn fools. Also the
 20136	day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin's King picked it up in the
 20137	wake fifty yards astern. Live by their wits. They wheeled, flapping.
 20138	
 20139	     _The hungry famished gull
 20140	     Flaps o'er the waters dull._
 20141	
 20142	That is how poets write, the similar sounds. But then Shakespeare has
 20143	no rhymes: blank verse. The flow of the language it is. The thoughts.
 20144	Solemn.
 20145	
 20146	
 20147	     _Hamlet, I am thy father's spirit
 20148	     Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth._
 20149	     --Two apples a penny! Two for a penny!
 20150	
 20151	
 20152	His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand. Australians
 20153	they must be this time of year. Shiny peels: polishes them up with a rag
 20154	or a handkerchief.
 20155	
 20156	Wait. Those poor birds.
 20157	
 20158	He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for
 20159	a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into
 20160	the Liffey. See that? The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from
 20161	their heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel.
 20162	
 20163	Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his
 20164	hands. They never expected that. Manna. Live on fish, fishy flesh they
 20165	have, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swim down
 20166	here sometimes to preen themselves. No accounting for tastes. Wonder
 20167	what kind is swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.
 20168	
 20169	They wheeled flapping weakly. I'm not going to throw any more. Penny
 20170	quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread foot and
 20171	mouth disease too. If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes
 20172	like that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish are
 20173	not salty? How is that?
 20174	
 20175	His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor
 20176	on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.
 20177	
 20178	_Kino's_ 11/- _Trousers_
 20179	
 20180	Good idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you
 20181	own water really? It's always flowing in a stream, never the same, which
 20182	in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All kinds of
 20183	places are good for ads. That quack doctor for the clap used to be stuck
 20184	up in all the greenhouses. Never see it now. Strictly confidential. Dr
 20185	Hy Franks. Didn't cost him a red like Maginni the dancing master self
 20186	advertisement. Got fellows to stick them up or stick them up himself for
 20187	that matter on the q. t. running in to loosen a button. Flybynight.
 20188	Just the place too. POST NO BILLS. POST 110 PILLS. Some chap with a dose
 20189	burning him.
 20190	
 20191	If he...?
 20192	
 20193	O!
 20194	
 20195	Eh?
 20196	
 20197	No... No.
 20198	
 20199	No, no. I don't believe it. He wouldn't surely?
 20200	
 20201	No, no.
 20202	
 20203	Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about
 20204	that. After one. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Dunsink time.
 20205	Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball's. Parallax. I never
 20206	exactly understood. There's a priest. Could ask him. Par it's Greek:
 20207	parallel, parallax. Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her
 20208	about the transmigration. O rocks!
 20209	
 20210	Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice. She's right
 20211	after all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.
 20212	She's not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was thinking.
 20213	Still, I don't know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone
 20214	voice. He has legs like barrels and you'd think he was singing into a
 20215	barrel. Now, isn't that wit. They used to call him big Ben. Not half as
 20216	witty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an albatross. Get
 20217	outside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at stowing away number
 20218	one Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.
 20219	
 20220	A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him
 20221	along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like
 20222	that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He
 20223	read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S.
 20224	Wisdom Hely's. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his
 20225	foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Our
 20226	staple food. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after
 20227	street. Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are
 20228	not Boyl: no, M Glade's men. Doesn't bring in any business either.
 20229	I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls
 20230	sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I
 20231	bet that would have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the
 20232	eye at once. Everyone dying to know what she's writing. Get twenty of
 20233	them round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women
 20234	too. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn't have it of course because he
 20235	didn't think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a
 20236	false stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree's potted
 20237	under the obituaries, cold meat department. You can't lick 'em. What?
 20238	Our envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you going? Can't stop, Robinson,
 20239	I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser _Kansell,_ sold
 20240	by Hely's Ltd, 85 Dame street. Well out of that ruck I am. Devil of a
 20241	job it was collecting accounts of those convents. Tranquilla convent.
 20242	That was a nice nun there, really sweet face. Wimple suited her small
 20243	head. Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes.
 20244	Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman. I disturbed her at her
 20245	devotions that morning. But glad to communicate with the outside world.
 20246	Our great day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name
 20247	too: caramel. She knew I, I think she knew by the way she. If she had
 20248	married she would have changed. I suppose they really were short of
 20249	money. Fried everything in the best butter all the same. No lard for
 20250	them. My heart's broke eating dripping. They like buttering themselves
 20251	in and out. Molly tasting it, her veil up. Sister? Pat Claffey, the
 20252	pawnbroker's daughter. It was a nun they say invented barbed wire.
 20253	
 20254	He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. Rover
 20255	cycleshop. Those races are on today. How long ago is that? Year Phil
 20256	Gilligan died. We were in Lombard street west. Wait: was in Thom's.
 20257	Got the job in Wisdom Hely's year we married. Six years. Ten years ago:
 20258	ninetyfour he died yes that's right the big fire at Arnott's. Val Dillon
 20259	was lord mayor. The Glencree dinner. Alderman Robert O'Reilly emptying
 20260	the port into his soup before the flag fell. Bobbob lapping it for the
 20261	inner alderman. Couldn't hear what the band played. For what we have
 20262	already received may the Lord make us. Milly was a kiddy then. Molly
 20263	had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs. Mantailored with
 20264	selfcovered buttons. She didn't like it because I sprained my ankle
 20265	first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf. As if that. Old
 20266	Goodwin's tall hat done up with some sticky stuff. Flies' picnic
 20267	too. Never put a dress on her back like it. Fitted her like a glove,
 20268	shoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out well. Rabbitpie we
 20269	had that day. People looking after her.
 20270	
 20271	Happy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.
 20272	Dockrell's, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly's tubbing night. American
 20273	soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she
 20274	looked soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa's
 20275	daguerreotype atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.
 20276	
 20277	He walked along the curbstone.
 20278	
 20279	Stream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always
 20280	squinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in Citron's saint
 20281	Kevin's parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is getting. Pen
 20282	...? Of course it's years ago. Noise of the trams probably. Well, if he
 20283	couldn't remember the dayfather's name that he sees every day.
 20284	
 20285	Bartell d'Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home
 20286	after practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her
 20287	that song _Winds that blow from the south_.
 20288	
 20289	Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on
 20290	about those lottery tickets after Goodwin's concert in the supperroom or
 20291	oakroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of her music blew
 20292	out of my hand against the High school railings. Lucky it didn't.
 20293	Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin
 20294	linking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell
 20295	concerts. Positively last appearance on any stage. May be for months and
 20296	may be for never. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar
 20297	up. Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her
 20298	skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin. She did get flushed
 20299	in the wind. Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up
 20300	those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she
 20301	liked. And the mulled rum. Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth
 20302	unclamping the busk of her stays: white.
 20303	
 20304	Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her.
 20305	Always liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near two
 20306	taking out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy.
 20307	That was the night...
 20308	
 20309	--O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?
 20310	
 20311	--O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?
 20312	
 20313	--No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven't seen her for
 20314	ages.
 20315	
 20316	--In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down in
 20317	Mullingar, you know.
 20318	
 20319	--Go away! Isn't that grand for her?
 20320	
 20321	--Yes. In a photographer's there. Getting on like a house on fire. How
 20322	are all your charges?
 20323	
 20324	--All on the baker's list, Mrs Breen said.
 20325	
 20326	How many has she? No other in sight.
 20327	
 20328	--You're in black, I see. You have no...
 20329	
 20330	--No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.
 20331	
 20332	Going to crop up all day, I foresee. Who's dead, when and what did he
 20333	die of? Turn up like a bad penny.
 20334	
 20335	--O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn't any near relation.
 20336	
 20337	May as well get her sympathy.
 20338	
 20339	--Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly,
 20340	poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.
 20341	
 20342	_Your funeral's tomorrow While you're coming through the rye.
 20343	Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle..._
 20344	
 20345	--Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen's womaneyes said melancholily.
 20346	
 20347	Now that's quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.
 20348	
 20349	--And your lord and master?
 20350	
 20351	Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn't lost them anyhow.
 20352	
 20353	--O, don't be talking! she said. He's a caution to rattlesnakes. He's
 20354	in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me
 20355	heartscalded. Wait till I show you.
 20356	
 20357	Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured
 20358	out from Harrison's. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom's
 20359	gullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar,
 20360	or they'd taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot
 20361	arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of
 20362	hunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork
 20363	chained to the table.
 20364	
 20365	Opening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on
 20366	those things. Stick it in a chap's eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open.
 20367	Money. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain.
 20368	Husband barging. Where's the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are
 20369	you feeding your little brother's family? Soiled handkerchief:
 20370	medicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she?...
 20371	
 20372	--There must be a new moon out, she said. He's always bad then. Do you
 20373	know what he did last night?
 20374	
 20375	Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in
 20376	alarm, yet smiling.
 20377	
 20378	--What? Mr Bloom asked.
 20379	
 20380	Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.
 20381	
 20382	--Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.
 20383	
 20384	Indiges.
 20385	
 20386	--Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.
 20387	
 20388	--The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.
 20389	
 20390	She took a folded postcard from her handbag.
 20391	
 20392	--Read that, she said. He got it this morning.
 20393	
 20394	--What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.P.?
 20395	
 20396	--U.P.: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It's a great
 20397	shame for them whoever he is.
 20398	
 20399	--Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.
 20400	
 20401	She took back the card, sighing.
 20402	
 20403	--And now he's going round to Mr Menton's office. He's going to take an
 20404	action for ten thousand pounds, he says.
 20405	
 20406	She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.
 20407	
 20408	Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its
 20409	best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three old
 20410	grapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a
 20411	tasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than
 20412	Molly.
 20413	
 20414	See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.
 20415	
 20416	He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.
 20417	Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I'm hungry too. Flakes of pastry
 20418	on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek.
 20419	Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie Powell
 20420	that was. In Luke Doyle's long ago. Dolphin's Barn, the charades. U.P.:
 20421	up.
 20422	
 20423	Change the subject.
 20424	
 20425	--Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.
 20426	
 20427	--Mina Purefoy? she said.
 20428	
 20429	Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers' Club. Matcham often thinks of
 20430	the masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.
 20431	
 20432	--Yes.
 20433	
 20434	--I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She's in the
 20435	lying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She's three
 20436	days bad now.
 20437	
 20438	--O, Mr Bloom said. I'm sorry to hear that.
 20439	
 20440	--Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It's a very stiff
 20441	birth, the nurse told me.
 20442	
 20443	---O, Mr Bloom said.
 20444	
 20445	His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in
 20446	compassion. Dth! Dth!
 20447	
 20448	--I'm sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That's
 20449	terrible for her.
 20450	
 20451	Mrs Breen nodded.
 20452	
 20453	--She was taken bad on the Tuesday...
 20454	
 20455	Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:
 20456	
 20457	--Mind! Let this man pass.
 20458	
 20459	A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a
 20460	rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a
 20461	skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat,
 20462	a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.
 20463	
 20464	--Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts.
 20465	Watch!
 20466	
 20467	--Who is he if it's a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?
 20468	
 20469	--His name is Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr
 20470	Bloom said smiling. Watch!
 20471	
 20472	--He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these
 20473	days.
 20474	
 20475	She broke off suddenly.
 20476	
 20477	--There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to
 20478	Molly, won't you?
 20479	
 20480	--I will, Mr Bloom said.
 20481	
 20482	He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen
 20483	in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison's
 20484	hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay. Like old
 20485	times. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust
 20486	his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke
 20487	earnestly.
 20488	
 20489	Meshuggah. Off his chump.
 20490	
 20491	Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the
 20492	tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two
 20493	days. Watch him! Out he goes again. One way of getting on in the world.
 20494	And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds. Hard time she must have
 20495	with him.
 20496	
 20497	U.P.: up. I'll take my oath that's Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. Wrote
 20498	it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything. Round to Menton's
 20499	office. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a feast for the
 20500	gods.
 20501	
 20502	He passed the _Irish Times_. There might be other answers Iying there.
 20503	Like to answer them all. Good system for criminals. Code. At their lunch
 20504	now. Clerk with the glasses there doesn't know me. O, leave them there
 20505	to simmer. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them. Wanted, smart
 20506	lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work. I called you naughty
 20507	darling because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is
 20508	the meaning. Please tell me what perfume does your wife. Tell me who
 20509	made the world. The way they spring those questions on you. And the
 20510	other one Lizzie Twigg. My literary efforts have had the good fortune to
 20511	meet with the approval of the eminent poet A. E. (Mr Geo. Russell). No
 20512	time to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of poetry.
 20513	
 20514	Best paper by long chalks for a small ad. Got the provinces now. Cook
 20515	and general, exc. cuisine, housemaid kept. Wanted live man for spirit
 20516	counter. Resp. girl (R.C.) wishes to hear of post in fruit or pork shop.
 20517	James Carlisle made that. Six and a half per cent dividend. Made a big
 20518	deal on Coates's shares. Ca' canny. Cunning old Scotch hunks. All the
 20519	toady news. Our gracious and popular vicereine. Bought the _Irish Field_
 20520	now. Lady Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement and
 20521	rode out with the Ward Union staghounds at the enlargement yesterday
 20522	at Rathoath. Uneatable fox. Pothunters too. Fear injects juices make
 20523	it tender enough for them. Riding astride. Sit her horse like a man.
 20524	Weightcarrying huntress. No sidesaddle or pillion for her, not for Joe.
 20525	First to the meet and in at the death. Strong as a brood mare some of
 20526	those horsey women. Swagger around livery stables. Toss off a glass
 20527	of brandy neat while you'd say knife. That one at the Grosvenor this
 20528	morning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Stonewall or fivebarred gate
 20529	put her mount to it. Think that pugnosed driver did it out of spite. Who
 20530	is this she was like? O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that sold me her old
 20531	wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel. Divorced Spanish
 20532	American. Didn't take a feather out of her my handling them. As if I was
 20533	her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when Stubbs the park
 20534	ranger got me in with Whelan of the _Express._ Scavenging what the
 20535	quality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the plums thinking it was
 20536	custard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few weeks after. Want to
 20537	be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work for her, thanks.
 20538	
 20539	Poor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband. Method in his madness. Saffron bun
 20540	and milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy. Y. M. C. A. Eating
 20541	with a stopwatch, thirtytwo chews to the minute. And still his
 20542	muttonchop whiskers grew. Supposed to be well connected. Theodore's
 20543	cousin in Dublin Castle. One tony relative in every family. Hardy
 20544	annuals he presents her with. Saw him out at the Three Jolly Topers
 20545	marching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a
 20546	marketnet. The squallers. Poor thing! Then having to give the breast
 20547	year after year all hours of the night. Selfish those t.t's are. Dog in
 20548	the manger. Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.
 20549	
 20550	He stood at Fleet street crossing. Luncheon interval. A sixpenny at
 20551	Rowe's? Must look up that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in
 20552	the Burton. Better. On my way.
 20553	
 20554	He walked on past Bolton's Westmoreland house. Tea. Tea. Tea. I forgot
 20555	to tap Tom Kernan.
 20556	
 20557	Sss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a
 20558	vinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Phew!
 20559	Dreadful simply! Child's head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her
 20560	trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out. Kill me
 20561	that would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent
 20562	something to stop that. Life with hard labour. Twilight sleep idea:
 20563	queen Victoria was given that. Nine she had. A good layer. Old
 20564	woman that lived in a shoe she had so many children. Suppose he was
 20565	consumptive. Time someone thought about it instead of gassing about the
 20566	what was it the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence. Flapdoodle to
 20567	feed fools on. They could easily have big establishments whole thing
 20568	quite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at
 20569	compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings
 20570	and five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage
 20571	people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years
 20572	want to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.
 20573	
 20574	Not stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for
 20575	nothing.
 20576	
 20577	Funny sight two of them together, their bellies out. Molly and Mrs
 20578	Moisel. Mothers' meeting. Phthisis retires for the time being, then
 20579	returns. How flat they look all of a sudden after. Peaceful eyes. Weight
 20580	off their mind. Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. All my babies,
 20581	she said. The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them. O, that's
 20582	nyumnyum. Got her hand crushed by old Tom Wall's son. His first bow to
 20583	the public. Head like a prize pumpkin. Snuffy Dr Murren. People knocking
 20584	them up at all hours. For God' sake, doctor. Wife in her throes. Then
 20585	keep them waiting months for their fee. To attendance on your wife. No
 20586	gratitude in people. Humane doctors, most of them.
 20587	
 20588	Before the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of
 20589	pigeons flew. Their little frolic after meals. Who will we do it on? I
 20590	pick the fellow in black. Here goes. Here's good luck. Must be thrilling
 20591	from the air. Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the trees near
 20592	Goose green playing the monkeys. Mackerel they called me.
 20593	
 20594	A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian
 20595	file. Goosestep. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their
 20596	truncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their
 20597	belts. Policeman's lot is oft a happy one. They split up in groups and
 20598	scattered, saluting, towards their beats. Let out to graze. Best moment
 20599	to attack one in pudding time. A punch in his dinner. A squad of others,
 20600	marching irregularly, rounded Trinity railings making for the station.
 20601	Bound for their troughs. Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare to receive
 20602	soup.
 20603	
 20604	He crossed under Tommy Moore's roguish finger. They did right to put him
 20605	up over a urinal: meeting of the waters. Ought to be places for women.
 20606	Running into cakeshops. Settle my hat straight. _There is not in this
 20607	wide world a vallee_. Great song of Julia Morkan's. Kept her voice up to
 20608	the very last. Pupil of Michael Balfe's, wasn't she?
 20609	
 20610	He gazed after the last broad tunic. Nasty customers to tackle. Jack
 20611	Power could a tale unfold: father a G man. If a fellow gave them trouble
 20612	being lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the bridewell.
 20613	Can't blame them after all with the job they have especially the young
 20614	hornies. That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was given his
 20615	degree in Trinity he got a run for his money. My word he did! His
 20616	horse's hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. Lucky I had the
 20617	presence of mind to dive into Manning's or I was souped. He did come a
 20618	wallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on the cobblestones. I
 20619	oughtn't to have got myself swept along with those medicals. And the
 20620	Trinity jibs in their mortarboards. Looking for trouble. Still I got to
 20621	know that young Dixon who dressed that sting for me in the Mater and now
 20622	he's in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy. Wheels within wheels. Police
 20623	whistle in my ears still. All skedaddled. Why he fixed on me. Give me in
 20624	charge. Right here it began.
 20625	
 20626	--Up the Boers!
 20627	
 20628	--Three cheers for De Wet!
 20629	
 20630	--We'll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.
 20631	
 20632	Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill.
 20633	The Butter exchange band. Few years' time half of them magistrates and
 20634	civil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows
 20635	used to. Whether on the scaffold high.
 20636	
 20637	Never know who you're talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in
 20638	his eye. Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff on
 20639	the invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to
 20640	get in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the castle.
 20641	Drop him like a hot potato. Why those plainclothes men are always
 20642	courting slaveys. Easily twig a man used to uniform. Squarepushing up
 20643	against a backdoor. Maul her a bit. Then the next thing on the menu. And
 20644	who is the gentleman does be visiting there? Was the young master saying
 20645	anything? Peeping Tom through the keyhole. Decoy duck. Hotblooded young
 20646	student fooling round her fat arms ironing.
 20647	
 20648	--Are those yours, Mary?
 20649	
 20650	--I don't wear such things... Stop or I'll tell the missus on you. Out
 20651	half the night.
 20652	
 20653	--There are great times coming, Mary. Wait till you see.
 20654	
 20655	--Ah, gelong with your great times coming.
 20656	
 20657	Barmaids too. Tobaccoshopgirls.
 20658	
 20659	James Stephens' idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that
 20660	a fellow couldn't round on more than his own ring. Sinn Fein. Back out
 20661	you get the knife. Hidden hand. Stay in. The firing squad. Turnkey's
 20662	daughter got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk. Putting up in the
 20663	Buckingham Palace hotel under their very noses. Garibaldi.
 20664	
 20665	You must have a certain fascination: Parnell. Arthur Griffith is a
 20666	squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. Or gas about
 20667	our lovely land. Gammon and spinach. Dublin Bakery Company's tearoom.
 20668	Debating societies. That republicanism is the best form of government.
 20669	That the language question should take precedence of the economic
 20670	question. Have your daughters inveigling them to your house. Stuff them
 20671	up with meat and drink. Michaelmas goose. Here's a good lump of thyme
 20672	seasoning under the apron for you. Have another quart of goosegrease
 20673	before it gets too cold. Halffed enthusiasts. Penny roll and a walk with
 20674	the band. No grace for the carver. The thought that the other chap pays
 20675	best sauce in the world. Make themselves thoroughly at home. Show us
 20676	over those apricots, meaning peaches. The not far distant day. Homerule
 20677	sun rising up in the northwest.
 20678	
 20679	His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly,
 20680	shadowing Trinity's surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing,
 20681	outgoing, clanging. Useless words. Things go on same, day after day:
 20682	squads of police marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies
 20683	mooching about. Dignam carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a
 20684	bed groaning to have a child tugged out of her. One born every second
 20685	somewhere. Other dying every second. Since I fed the birds five minutes.
 20686	Three hundred kicked the bucket. Other three hundred born, washing the
 20687	blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling maaaaaa.
 20688	
 20689	Cityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other
 20690	coming on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of
 20691	pavements, piledup bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that.
 20692	Landlord never dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets
 20693	his notice to quit. They buy the place up with gold and still they have
 20694	all the gold. Swindle in it somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away age
 20695	after age. Pyramids in sand. Built on bread and onions. Slaves Chinese
 20696	wall. Babylon. Big stones left. Round towers. Rest rubble, sprawling
 20697	suburbs, jerrybuilt. Kerwan's mushroom houses built of breeze. Shelter,
 20698	for the night.
 20699	
 20700	No-one is anything.
 20701	
 20702	This is the very worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate
 20703	this hour. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.
 20704	
 20705	Provost's house. The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon. Well tinned in
 20706	there. Like a mortuary chapel. Wouldn't live in it if they paid me. Hope
 20707	they have liver and bacon today. Nature abhors a vacuum.
 20708	
 20709	The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the silverware
 20710	opposite in Walter Sexton's window by which John Howard Parnell passed,
 20711	unseeing.
 20712	
 20713	There he is: the brother. Image of him. Haunting face. Now that's a
 20714	coincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don't
 20715	meet him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be a
 20716	corporation meeting today. They say he never put on the city marshal's
 20717	uniform since he got the job. Charley Kavanagh used to come out on
 20718	his high horse, cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved. Look at the
 20719	woebegone walk of him. Eaten a bad egg. Poached eyes on ghost. I have a
 20720	pain. Great man's brother: his brother's brother. He'd look nice on the
 20721	city charger. Drop into the D.B.C. probably for his coffee, play chess
 20722	there. His brother used men as pawns. Let them all go to pot. Afraid to
 20723	pass a remark on him. Freeze them up with that eye of his. That's the
 20724	fascination: the name. All a bit touched. Mad Fanny and his other sister
 20725	Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness. Bolt upright lik
 20726	surgeon M'Ardle. Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath. Apply
 20727	for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life. The patriot's
 20728	banquet. Eating orangepeels in the park. Simon Dedalus said when they
 20729	put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the grave and
 20730	lead him out of the house of commons by the arm.
 20731	
 20732	--Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which
 20733	the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks with
 20734	a Scotch accent. The tentacles...
 20735	
 20736	They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. Beard and bicycle.
 20737	Young woman.
 20738	
 20739	And there he is too. Now that's really a coincidence: second time.
 20740	Coming events cast their shadows before. With the approval of the
 20741	eminent poet, Mr Geo. Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. A.
 20742	E.: what does that mean? Initials perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur Edmund,
 20743	Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire. What was he saying? The ends of the world
 20744	with a Scotch accent. Tentacles: octopus. Something occult: symbolism.
 20745	Holding forth. She's taking it all in. Not saying a word. To aid
 20746	gentleman in literary work.
 20747	
 20748	His eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle,
 20749	a listening woman at his side. Coming from the vegetarian. Only
 20750	weggebobbles and fruit. Don't eat a beefsteak. If you do the eyes of
 20751	that cow will pursue you through all eternity. They say it's healthier.
 20752	Windandwatery though. Tried it. Keep you on the run all day. Bad as
 20753	a bloater. Dreams all night. Why do they call that thing they gave me
 20754	nutsteak? Nutarians. Fruitarians. To give you the idea you are eating
 20755	rumpsteak. Absurd. Salty too. They cook in soda. Keep you sitting by the
 20756	tap all night.
 20757	
 20758	Her stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless.
 20759	Those literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy,
 20760	symbolistic. Esthetes they are. I wouldn't be surprised if it was that
 20761	kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical.
 20762	For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts
 20763	you couldn't squeeze a line of poetry out of him. Don't know what poetry
 20764	is even. Must be in a certain mood.
 20765	
 20766	     _The dreamy cloudy gull
 20767	     Waves o'er the waters dull._
 20768	
 20769	He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates
 20770	and Son, pricing the fieldglasses. Or will I drop into old Harris's and
 20771	have a chat with young Sinclair? Wellmannered fellow. Probably at his
 20772	lunch. Must get those old glasses of mine set right. Goerz lenses six
 20773	guineas. Germans making their way everywhere. Sell on easy terms to
 20774	capture trade. Undercutting. Might chance on a pair in the railway lost
 20775	property office. Astonishing the things people leave behind them in
 20776	trains and cloakrooms. What do they be thinking about? Women too.
 20777	Incredible. Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up that farmer's
 20778	daughter's ba and hand it to her at Limerick junction. Unclaimed money
 20779	too. There's a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test
 20780	those glasses by.
 20781	
 20782	
 20783	His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides. Can't see it. If you
 20784	imagine it's there you can almost see it. Can't see it.
 20785	
 20786	He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right
 20787	hand at arm's length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes:
 20788	completely. The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun's disk.
 20789	Must be the focus where the rays cross. If I had black glasses.
 20790	Interesting. There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we
 20791	were in Lombard street west. Looking up from the back garden. Terrific
 20792	explosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn
 20793	some time.
 20794	
 20795	Now that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time. It's
 20796	the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there
 20797	some first Saturday of the month. If I could get an introduction to
 20798	professor Joly or learn up something about his family. That would do to:
 20799	man always feels complimented. Flattery where least expected. Nobleman
 20800	proud to be descended from some king's mistress. His foremother. Lay it
 20801	on with a trowel. Cap in hand goes through the land. Not go in and blurt
 20802	out what you know you're not to: what's parallax? Show this gentleman
 20803	the door.
 20804	
 20805	Ah.
 20806	
 20807	His hand fell to his side again.
 20808	
 20809	Never know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about,
 20810	crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then solid:
 20811	then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock,
 20812	like that pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon out, she said. I
 20813	believe there is.
 20814	
 20815	He went on by la maison Claire.
 20816	
 20817	Wait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there
 20818	is a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. Not bad for a Fairview moon.
 20819	She was humming. The young May moon she's beaming, love. He other side
 20820	of her. Elbow, arm. He. Glowworm's la-amp is gleaming, love. Touch.
 20821	Fingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.
 20822	
 20823	Stop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.
 20824	
 20825	Mr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking passed Adam court.
 20826	
 20827	With a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here
 20828	middle of the day of Bob Doran's bottle shoulders. On his annual bend,
 20829	M Coy said. They drink in order to say or do something or _cherchez la
 20830	femme_. Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the
 20831	rest of the year sober as a judge.
 20832	
 20833	Yes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do him
 20834	good. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the
 20835	Queen's. Broth of a boy. Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon
 20836	face in a poky bonnet. Three Purty Maids from School. How time flies,
 20837	eh? Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts. Drinkers, drinking,
 20838	laughed spluttering, their drink against their breath. More power, Pat.
 20839	Coarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke. Take off that white
 20840	hat. His parboiled eyes. Where is he now? Beggar somewhere. The harp
 20841	that once did starve us all.
 20842	
 20843	I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was. She
 20844	twentythree. When we left Lombard street west something changed. Could
 20845	never like it again after Rudy. Can't bring back time. Like holding
 20846	water in your hand. Would you go back to then? Just beginning then.
 20847	Would you? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?
 20848	Wants to sew on buttons for me. I must answer. Write it in the library.
 20849	
 20850	Grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints,
 20851	silkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in the
 20852	baking causeway. Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings. Hope
 20853	the rain mucks them up on her. Countrybred chawbacon. All the beef to
 20854	the heels were in. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out of
 20855	plumb.
 20856	
 20857	He passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers. Cascades
 20858	of ribbons. Flimsy China silks. A tilted urn poured from its mouth a
 20859	flood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. The huguenots brought that
 20860	here. _La causa Ã¨ santa_! Tara tara. Great chorus that. Taree tara. Must
 20861	be washed in rainwater. Meyerbeer. Tara: bom bom bom.
 20862	
 20863	Pincushions. I'm a long time threatening to buy one. Sticking them all
 20864	over the place. Needles in window curtains.
 20865	
 20866	He bared slightly his left forearm. Scrape: nearly gone. Not today
 20867	anyhow. Must go back for that lotion. For her birthday perhaps.
 20868	Junejulyaugseptember eighth. Nearly three months off. Then she mightn't
 20869	like it. Women won't pick up pins. Say it cuts lo.
 20870	
 20871	Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk
 20872	stockings.
 20873	
 20874	Useless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.
 20875	
 20876	High voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home and
 20877	houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. Agendath Netaim.
 20878	Wealth of the world.
 20879	
 20880	A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded.
 20881	Perfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he
 20882	mutely craved to adore.
 20883	
 20884	Duke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.
 20885	
 20886	He turned Combridge's corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds.
 20887	Perfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields,
 20888	tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas,
 20889	creaking beds.
 20890	
 20891	--Jack, love!
 20892	
 20893	--Darling!
 20894	
 20895	--Kiss me, Reggy!
 20896	
 20897	--My boy!
 20898	
 20899	--Love!
 20900	
 20901	His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink
 20902	gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens. See
 20903	the animals feed.
 20904	
 20905	Men, men, men.
 20906	
 20907	Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables
 20908	calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy
 20909	food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A pallid suetfaced
 20910	young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin. New
 20911	set of microbes. A man with an infant's saucestained napkin tucked round
 20912	him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet. A man spitting back on his
 20913	plate: halfmasticated gristle: gums: no teeth to chewchewchew it. Chump
 20914	chop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad booser's eyes. Bitten
 20915	off more than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves as others see
 20916	us. Hungry man is an angry man. Working tooth and jaw. Don't! O! A bone!
 20917	That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself
 20918	at Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what he was eating. Something
 20919	galoptious. Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity. Couldn't
 20920	swallow it all however.
 20921	
 20922	--Roast beef and cabbage.
 20923	
 20924	--One stew.
 20925	
 20926	Smells of men. His gorge rose. Spaton sawdust, sweetish warmish
 20927	cigarette smoke, reek of plug, spilt beer, men's beery piss, the stale
 20928	of ferment.
 20929	
 20930	Couldn't eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all
 20931	before him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing
 20932	the cud. Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then
 20933	on that. Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it
 20934	off the plate, man! Get out of this.
 20935	
 20936	He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of
 20937	his nose.
 20938	
 20939	--Two stouts here.
 20940	
 20941	--One corned and cabbage.
 20942	
 20943	That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended
 20944	on it. Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat from his
 20945	three hands. Tear it limb from limb. Second nature to him. Born with a
 20946	silver knife in his mouth. That's witty, I think. Or no. Silver means
 20947	born rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.
 20948	
 20949	An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the head
 20950	bailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard. Well
 20951	up: it splashed yellow near his boot. A diner, knife and fork upright,
 20952	elbows on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the foodlift
 20953	across his stained square of newspaper. Other chap telling him something
 20954	with his mouth full. Sympathetic listener. Table talk. I munched hum un
 20955	thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday. Ha? Did you, faith?
 20956	
 20957	Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said:
 20958	
 20959	--Not here. Don't see him.
 20960	
 20961	Out. I hate dirty eaters.
 20962	
 20963	He backed towards the door. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne's. Stopgap.
 20964	Keep me going. Had a good breakfast.
 20965	
 20966	--Roast and mashed here.
 20967	
 20968	--Pint of stout.
 20969	
 20970	Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.
 20971	
 20972	He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street. Eat
 20973	or be eaten. Kill! Kill!
 20974	
 20975	Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down
 20976	with porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the
 20977	street. John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every
 20978	mother's son don't talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity women
 20979	and children cabmen priests parsons fieldmarshals archbishops. From
 20980	Ailesbury road, Clyde road, artisans' dwellings, north Dublin union,
 20981	lord mayor in his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. My
 20982	plate's empty. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. Like sir
 20983	Philip Crampton's fountain. Rub off the microbes with your handkerchief.
 20984	Next chap rubs on a new batch with his. Father O'Flynn would make
 20985	hares of them all. Have rows all the same. All for number one. Children
 20986	fighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a souppot as big as the
 20987	Phoenix park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of it. Hate
 20988	people all round you. City Arms hotel _table d'hÃ´te_ she called it.
 20989	Soup, joint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you're chewing. Then
 20990	who'd wash up all the plates and forks? Might be all feeding on tabloids
 20991	that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.
 20992	
 20993	After all there's a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from
 20994	the earth garlic of course it stinks after Italian organgrinders crisp
 20995	of onions mushrooms truffles. Pain to the animal too. Pluck and draw
 20996	fowl. Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe
 20997	to split their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering
 20998	bob. Bubble and squeak. Butchers' buckets wobbly lights. Give us that
 20999	brisket off the hook. Plup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed
 21000	sheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling
 21001	nosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers going out. Don't maul them pieces,
 21002	young one.
 21003	
 21004	Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed.
 21005	Insidious. Lick it up smokinghot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.
 21006	
 21007	Ah, I'm hungry.
 21008	
 21009	He entered Davy Byrne's. Moral pub. He doesn't chat. Stands a drink now
 21010	and then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.
 21011	
 21012	What will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?
 21013	
 21014	--Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.
 21015	
 21016	--Hello, Flynn.
 21017	
 21018	--How's things?
 21019	
 21020	--Tiptop... Let me see. I'll take a glass of burgundy and... let me
 21021	see.
 21022	
 21023	Sardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham
 21024	and his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is home
 21025	without Plumtree's potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the
 21026	obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam's potted meat.
 21027	Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like
 21028	pickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of honour. Ought to be
 21029	tough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch the effect. _There was
 21030	a right royal old nigger. Who ate or something the somethings of the
 21031	reverend Mr MacTrigger_. With it an abode of bliss. Lord knows what
 21032	concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked and minced up. Puzzle
 21033	find the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together. Hygiene that was what
 21034	they call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside. Peace and
 21035	war depend on some fellow's digestion. Religions. Christmas turkeys and
 21036	geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be merry. Then casual wards
 21037	full after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all but itself. Mity cheese.
 21038	
 21039	--Have you a cheese sandwich?
 21040	
 21041	--Yes, sir.
 21042	
 21043	Like a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of
 21044	burgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber,
 21045	Tom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served
 21046	me that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God made
 21047	food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.
 21048	
 21049	--Wife well?
 21050	
 21051	--Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?
 21052	
 21053	--Yes, sir.
 21054	
 21055	Nosey Flynn sipped his grog.
 21056	
 21057	--Doing any singing those times?
 21058	
 21059	Look at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match.
 21060	Music. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him.
 21061	Does no harm. Free ad.
 21062	
 21063	--She's engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard
 21064	perhaps.
 21065	
 21066	--No. O, that's the style. Who's getting it up?
 21067	
 21068	The curate served.
 21069	
 21070	--How much is that?
 21071	
 21072	--Seven d., sir... Thank you, sir.
 21073	
 21074	Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. _Mr MacTrigger_. Easier
 21075	than the dreamy creamy stuff. _His five hundred wives. Had the time of
 21076	their lives._
 21077	
 21078	--Mustard, sir?
 21079	
 21080	--Thank you.
 21081	
 21082	He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. _Their lives_. I have
 21083	it. _It grew bigger and bigger and bigger_.
 21084	
 21085	--Getting it up? he said. Well, it's like a company idea, you see. Part
 21086	shares and part profits.
 21087	
 21088	--Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket
 21089	to scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn't Blazes Boylan
 21090	mixed up in it?
 21091	
 21092	A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom's heart. He
 21093	raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock
 21094	five minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.
 21095	
 21096	His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly,
 21097	longingly.
 21098	
 21099	Wine.
 21100	
 21101	He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to
 21102	speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.
 21103	
 21104	--Yes, he said. He's the organiser in point of fact.
 21105	
 21106	No fear: no brains.
 21107	
 21108	Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.
 21109	
 21110	--He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that
 21111	boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello
 21112	barracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he
 21113	was telling me...
 21114	
 21115	Hope that dewdrop doesn't come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.
 21116	
 21117	--For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God
 21118	till further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is a
 21119	hairy chap.
 21120	
 21121	Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves,
 21122	cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring's blush. Whose
 21123	smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat
 21124	on the parsnips.
 21125	
 21126	--And here's himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give
 21127	us a good one for the Gold cup?
 21128	
 21129	--I'm off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a
 21130	horse.
 21131	
 21132	--You're right there, Nosey Flynn said.
 21133	
 21134	Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of
 21135	disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his
 21136	wine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather
 21137	with the chill off.
 21138	
 21139	Nice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like
 21140	the way it curves there.
 21141	
 21142	--I wouldn't do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined
 21143	many a man, the same horses.
 21144	
 21145	Vintners' sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits
 21146	for consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.
 21147	
 21148	--True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you're in the know. There's
 21149	no straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He's giving
 21150	Sceptre today. Zinfandel's the favourite, lord Howard de Walden's, won
 21151	at Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one
 21152	against Saint Amant a fortnight before.
 21153	
 21154	--That so? Davy Byrne said...
 21155	
 21156	He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned
 21157	its pages.
 21158	
 21159	--I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of
 21160	horseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm,
 21161	Rothschild's filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow
 21162	cap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O'Gaunt. He put me off it.
 21163	Ay.
 21164	
 21165	He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the
 21166	flutes.
 21167	
 21168	--Ay, he said, sighing.
 21169	
 21170	Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull.
 21171	Will I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him
 21172	forget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down again.
 21173	Cold nose he'd have kissing a woman. Still they might like. Prickly
 21174	beards they like. Dogs' cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling
 21175	stomach's Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling him in her
 21176	lap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!
 21177	
 21178	Wine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish
 21179	cheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I'm not thirsty. Bath
 21180	of course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o'clock I can.
 21181	Six. Six. Time will be gone then. She...
 21182	
 21183	Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so
 21184	off colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy
 21185	lobsters' claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of
 21186	shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the
 21187	French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing
 21188	in a thousand years. If you didn't know risky putting anything into your
 21189	mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you think good.
 21190	Gaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so on. Try it
 21191	on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting fruit.
 21192	Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need artificial
 21193	irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters. Unsightly like
 21194	a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too. Who found them
 21195	out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank oysters. Effect
 21196	on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this morning. Was he
 21197	oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed no June has
 21198	no ar no oysters. But there are people like things high. Tainted game.
 21199	Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs fifty years old,
 21200	blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each dish harmless might
 21201	mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That archduke Leopold was it no
 21202	yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs? Or who was it used to eat the
 21203	scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch in town. Of course aristocrats,
 21204	then the others copy to be in the fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour.
 21205	Raw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in
 21206	the sea to keep up the price. Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the
 21207	grand. Hock in green glasses. Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom
 21208	pearls. The _Ã©lite. CrÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me_. They want special dishes to
 21209	pretend they're. Hermit with a platter of pulse keep down the stings
 21210	of the flesh. Know me come eat with me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff,
 21211	Coffey, the butcher, right to venisons of the forest from his ex. Send
 21212	him back the half of a cow. Spread I saw down in the Master of the
 21213	Rolls' kitchen area. Whitehatted _chef_ like a rabbi. Combustible duck.
 21214	Curly cabbage _Ã  la duchesse de Parme_. Just as well to write it on the
 21215	bill of fare so you can know what you've eaten. Too many drugs spoil the
 21216	broth. I know it myself. Dosing it with Edwards' desiccated soup. Geese
 21217	stuffed silly for them. Lobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan.
 21218	Wouldn't mind being a waiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress,
 21219	halfnaked ladies. May I tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole,
 21220	miss Dubedat? Yes, do bedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect
 21221	that. A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney, I remember. _Du, de la_ French.
 21222	Still it's the same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped
 21223	the guts out of making money hand over fist finger in fishes' gills
 21224	can't write his name on a cheque think he was painting the landscape
 21225	with his mouth twisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of
 21226	brogues, worth fifty thousand pounds.
 21227	
 21228	Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.
 21229	
 21230	Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the winepress
 21231	grapes of Burgundy. Sun's heat it is. Seems to a secret touch telling me
 21232	memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under wild ferns
 21233	on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky. The bay purple
 21234	by the Lion's head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards Sutton.
 21235	Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.
 21236	Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub
 21237	my hand under her nape, you'll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft with
 21238	ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn
 21239	away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth.
 21240	Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed.
 21241	Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle. Joy: I ate
 21242	it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft warm sticky
 21243	gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes. Pebbles
 21244	fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a
 21245	nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants. Screened under ferns
 21246	she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips,
 21247	her stretched neck beating, woman's breasts full in her blouse of nun's
 21248	veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was
 21249	kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.
 21250	
 21251	Me. And me now.
 21252	
 21253	Stuck, the flies buzzed.
 21254	
 21255	His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab. Beauty:
 21256	it curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the
 21257	world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the round hall,
 21258	naked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don't care what man looks. All
 21259	to see. Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like Flynn. Suppose she
 21260	did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first? Mortal! Put you in
 21261	your proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes, all
 21262	ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and
 21263	turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it drinking electricity: gods'
 21264	food. Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we
 21265	stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung,
 21266	earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine. They have no. Never
 21267	looked. I'll look today. Keeper won't see. Bend down let something drop
 21268	see if she.
 21269	
 21270	Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to
 21271	do there to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and
 21272	walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men
 21273	lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.
 21274	
 21275	When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:
 21276	
 21277	--What is this he is? Isn't he in the insurance line?
 21278	
 21279	--He's out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for
 21280	the _Freeman._
 21281	
 21282	--I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?
 21283	
 21284	--Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?
 21285	
 21286	--I noticed he was in mourning.
 21287	
 21288	--Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at
 21289	home. You're right, by God. So he was.
 21290	
 21291	--I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a
 21292	gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their
 21293	minds.
 21294	
 21295	--It's not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before
 21296	yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan's
 21297	wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home
 21298	to his better half. She's well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.
 21299	
 21300	--And is he doing for the _Freeman?_ Davy Byrne said.
 21301	
 21302	Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.
 21303	
 21304	---He doesn't buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of
 21305	that.
 21306	
 21307	--How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.
 21308	
 21309	Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He
 21310	winked.
 21311	
 21312	--He's in the craft, he said.
 21313	
 21314	---Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.
 21315	
 21316	--Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He's
 21317	an excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg
 21318	up. I was told that by a--well, I won't say who.
 21319	
 21320	--Is that a fact?
 21321	
 21322	--O, it's a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you're
 21323	down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they're as close as
 21324	damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.
 21325	
 21326	Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:
 21327	
 21328	--Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!
 21329	
 21330	--There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find
 21331	out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and
 21332	swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint
 21333	Legers of Doneraile.
 21334	
 21335	Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:
 21336	
 21337	--And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here
 21338	and I never once saw him--you know, over the line.
 21339	
 21340	--God Almighty couldn't make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips
 21341	off when the fun gets too hot. Didn't you see him look at his watch? Ah,
 21342	you weren't there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does
 21343	he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he
 21344	does.
 21345	
 21346	--There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He's a safe man, I'd say.
 21347	
 21348	--He's not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He's been known
 21349	to put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O,
 21350	Bloom has his good points. But there's one thing he'll never do.
 21351	
 21352	His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.
 21353	
 21354	--I know, Davy Byrne said.
 21355	
 21356	--Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.
 21357	
 21358	Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning,
 21359	a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.
 21360	
 21361	--Day, Mr Byrne.
 21362	
 21363	--Day, gentlemen.
 21364	
 21365	They paused at the counter.
 21366	
 21367	--Who's standing? Paddy Leonard asked.
 21368	
 21369	--I'm sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.
 21370	
 21371	--Well, what'll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.
 21372	
 21373	--I'll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.
 21374	
 21375	--How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God' sake? What's
 21376	yours, Tom?
 21377	
 21378	--How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.
 21379	
 21380	For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and
 21381	hiccupped.
 21382	
 21383	--Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.
 21384	
 21385	--Certainly, sir.
 21386	
 21387	Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.
 21388	
 21389	--Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I'm standing drinks to! Cold
 21390	water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.
 21391	He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.
 21392	
 21393	--Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.
 21394	
 21395	Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before
 21396	him.
 21397	
 21398	--That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.
 21399	
 21400	--Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.
 21401	
 21402	Tom Rochford nodded and drank.
 21403	
 21404	--Is it Zinfandel?
 21405	
 21406	--Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I'm going to plunge five bob on my
 21407	own.
 21408	
 21409	--Tell us if you're worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard
 21410	said. Who gave it to you?
 21411	
 21412	Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.
 21413	
 21414	--So long! Nosey Flynn said.
 21415	
 21416	The others turned.
 21417	
 21418	--That's the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.
 21419	
 21420	--Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we'll take two
 21421	of your small Jamesons after that and a...
 21422	
 21423	--Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.
 21424	
 21425	--Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.
 21426	
 21427	Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth
 21428	smooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with
 21429	those Rontgen rays searchlight you could.
 21430	
 21431	At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the
 21432	cobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks
 21433	having fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom
 21434	coasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they move.
 21435	Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?
 21436	Wasting time explaining it to Flynn's mouth. Lean people long mouths.
 21437	Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent
 21438	free. Course then you'd have all the cranks pestering.
 21439	
 21440	He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:
 21441	
 21442	_Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M'invitasti._
 21443	
 21444	Feel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap
 21445	in the blues. Dutch courage. That _Kilkenny People_ in the national
 21446	library now I must.
 21447	
 21448	Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber,
 21449	turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way down,
 21450	swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the
 21451	body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of
 21452	intestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the
 21453	time with his insides entrails on show. Science.
 21454	
 21455	--_A cenar teco._
 21456	
 21457	What does that _teco_ mean? Tonight perhaps.
 21458	
 21459	     _Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited
 21460	     To come to supper tonight,
 21461	     The rum the rumdum._
 21462	
 21463	Doesn't go properly.
 21464	
 21465	Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That'll be two pounds ten about
 21466	two pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott's dyeworks
 21467	van over there. If I get Billy Prescott's ad: two fifteen. Five guineas
 21468	about. On the pig's back.
 21469	
 21470	Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new
 21471	garters.
 21472	
 21473	Today. Today. Not think.
 21474	
 21475	Tour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton,
 21476	Margate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely
 21477	seaside girls. Against John Long's a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy
 21478	thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages.
 21479	Will eat anything.
 21480	
 21481	Mr Bloom turned at Gray's confectioner's window of unbought tarts and
 21482	passed the reverend Thomas Connellan's bookstore. _Why I left the church
 21483	of Rome? Birds' Nest._ Women run him. They say they used to give pauper
 21484	children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.
 21485	Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews. Same
 21486	bait. Why we left the church of Rome.
 21487	
 21488	A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No
 21489	tram in sight. Wants to cross.
 21490	
 21491	--Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.
 21492	
 21493	The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He
 21494	moved his head uncertainly.
 21495	
 21496	--You're in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite.
 21497	Do you want to cross? There's nothing in the way.
 21498	
 21499	The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom's eye followed its
 21500	line and saw again the dyeworks' van drawn up before Drago's. Where I
 21501	saw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in
 21502	John Long's. Slaking his drouth.
 21503	
 21504	--There's a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it's not moving. I'll see you
 21505	across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?
 21506	
 21507	--Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.
 21508	
 21509	--Come, Mr Bloom said.
 21510	
 21511	He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to
 21512	guide it forward.
 21513	
 21514	Say something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust
 21515	what you tell them. Pass a common remark.
 21516	
 21517	--The rain kept off.
 21518	
 21519	No answer.
 21520	
 21521	Stains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different
 21522	for him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child's hand, his hand. Like
 21523	Milly's was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder
 21524	if he has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse's legs: tired
 21525	drudge get his doze. That's right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a
 21526	horse.
 21527	
 21528	--Thanks, sir.
 21529	
 21530	Knows I'm a man. Voice.
 21531	
 21532	--Right now? First turn to the left.
 21533	
 21534	The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing
 21535	his cane back, feeling again.
 21536	
 21537	Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone
 21538	tweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?
 21539	Must have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense
 21540	of volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonder
 21541	would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of
 21542	Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walk
 21543	in a beeline if he hadn't that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow
 21544	going in to be a priest.
 21545	
 21546	Penrose! That was that chap's name.
 21547	
 21548	Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers.
 21549	Tune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a
 21550	deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.
 21551	Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People
 21552	ought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly's birthday. Hates
 21553	sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.
 21554	
 21555	Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched
 21556	together. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the spring,
 21557	the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can't taste wines with your
 21558	eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say get no
 21559	pleasure.
 21560	
 21561	And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl
 21562	passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have
 21563	them all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his
 21564	mind's eye. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his
 21565	fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair,
 21566	for instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black.
 21567	Then passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of
 21568	white.
 21569	
 21570	Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two
 21571	shillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer's just here
 21572	too. Wait. Think over it.
 21573	
 21574	With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above
 21575	his ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt
 21576	the skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough.
 21577	The belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick
 21578	street. Perhaps to Levenston's dancing academy piano. Might be settling
 21579	my braces.
 21580	
 21581	Walking by Doran's publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat
 21582	and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of
 21583	his belly. But I know it's whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to
 21584	see.
 21585	
 21586	He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.
 21587	
 21588	Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would
 21589	he have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being
 21590	born that way? All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned
 21591	and drowned in New York. Holocaust. Karma they call that transmigration
 21592	for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.
 21593	Dear, dear, dear. Pity, of course: but somehow you can't cotton on to
 21594	them someway.
 21595	
 21596	Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons' hall. Solemn as Troy.
 21597	After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. Old legal cronies cracking
 21598	a magnum. Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat
 21599	school. I sentenced him to ten years. I suppose he'd turn up his nose
 21600	at that stuff I drank. Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a
 21601	dusty bottle. Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder's court.
 21602	Wellmeaning old man. Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their
 21603	percentage manufacturing crime. Sends them to the rightabout. The devil
 21604	on moneylenders. Gave Reuben J. a great strawcalling. Now he's really
 21605	what they call a dirty jew. Power those judges have. Crusty old topers
 21606	in wigs. Bear with a sore paw. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.
 21607	
 21608	Hello, placard. Mirus bazaar. His Excellency the lord lieutenant.
 21609	Sixteenth. Today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer's hospital. _The
 21610	Messiah_ was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out
 21611	there: Ballsbridge. Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a
 21612	leech. Wear out my welcome. Sure to know someone on the gate.
 21613	
 21614	Mr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.
 21615	
 21616	Straw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.
 21617	
 21618	His heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved to
 21619	the right.
 21620	
 21621	Is it? Almost certain. Won't look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too
 21622	heady. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Get on.
 21623	
 21624	Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.
 21625	Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?
 21626	
 21627	Didn't see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.
 21628	
 21629	The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold
 21630	statues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.
 21631	
 21632	No. Didn't see me. After two. Just at the gate.
 21633	
 21634	My heart!
 21635	
 21636	His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas
 21637	Deane was the Greek architecture.
 21638	
 21639	Look for something I.
 21640	
 21641	His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded
 21642	Agendath Netaim. Where did I?
 21643	
 21644	Busy looking.
 21645	
 21646	He thrust back quick Agendath.
 21647	
 21648	Afternoon she said.
 21649	
 21650	I am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. _Freeman._
 21651	Where did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Potato. Purse. Where?
 21652	
 21653	Hurry. Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart.
 21654	
 21655	His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap
 21656	lotion have to call tepid paper stuck. Ah soap there I yes. Gate.
 21657	
 21658	Safe!
 21659	
 21660	
 21661	Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:
 21662	
 21663	
 21664	--And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.
 21665	A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms
 21666	against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in
 21667	real life.
 21668	
 21669	He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step
 21670	backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.
 21671	
 21672	A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a
 21673	noiseless beck.
 21674	
 21675	--Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautiful
 21676	ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always
 21677	feels that Goethe's judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.
 21678	
 21679	Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door
 21680	he gave his large ear all to the attendant's words: heard them: and was
 21681	gone.
 21682	
 21683	Two left.
 21684	
 21685	--Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes
 21686	before his death.
 21687	
 21688	--Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with
 21689	elder's gall, to write _Paradise Lost_ at your dictation? _The Sorrows
 21690	of Satan_ he calls it.
 21691	
 21692	Smile. Smile Cranly's smile.
 21693	
 21694	     _First he tickled her
 21695	     Then he patted her
 21696	     Then he passed the female catheter.
 21697	     For he was a medical
 21698	     Jolly old medi..._
 21699	
 21700	--I feel you would need one more for _Hamlet._ Seven is dear to the
 21701	mystic mind. The shining seven W.B. calls them.
 21702	
 21703	Glittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought
 21704	the face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He laughed
 21705	low: a sizar's laugh of Trinity: unanswered.
 21706	
 21707	     _Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood
 21708	     Tears such as angels weep.
 21709	     Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta._
 21710	
 21711	He holds my follies hostage.
 21712	
 21713	Cranly's eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed
 21714	Kathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house.
 21715	And one more to hail him: _ave, rabbi_: the Tinahely twelve. In the
 21716	shadow of the glen he cooees for them. My soul's youth I gave him, night
 21717	by night. God speed. Good hunting.
 21718	
 21719	Mulligan has my telegram.
 21720	
 21721	Folly. Persist.
 21722	
 21723	--Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a
 21724	figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare's Hamlet though
 21725	I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.
 21726	
 21727	--All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his
 21728	shadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.
 21729	Clergymen's discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal
 21730	to us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a
 21731	work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of
 21732	Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley,
 21733	the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal
 21734	wisdom, Plato's world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of
 21735	schoolboys for schoolboys.
 21736	
 21737	A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike
 21738	me!
 21739	
 21740	--The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.
 21741	Aristotle was once Plato's schoolboy.
 21742	
 21743	--And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. One
 21744	can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.
 21745	
 21746	He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.
 21747	
 21748	Formless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the
 21749	heavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who
 21750	suffers in us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon
 21751	the altar. I am the sacrificial butter.
 21752	
 21753	Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name
 21754	Ineffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no
 21755	secret to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching
 21756	to see if they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of
 21757	light, born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the
 21758	plane of buddhi. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P.
 21759	must work off bad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very
 21760	illustrious sister H.P.B.'s elemental.
 21761	
 21762	O, fie! Out on't! _Pfuiteufel!_ You naughtn't to look, missus, so you
 21763	naughtn't when a lady's ashowing of her elemental.
 21764	
 21765	Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with
 21766	grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.
 21767	
 21768	--That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet's musings about
 21769	the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
 21770	undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato's.
 21771	
 21772	John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:
 21773	
 21774	--Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle
 21775	with Plato.
 21776	
 21777	--Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his
 21778	commonwealth?
 21779	
 21780	Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of
 21781	allhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the
 21782	street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through
 21783	spaces smaller than red globules of man's blood they creepycrawl after
 21784	Blake's buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a
 21785	shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to
 21786	the past.
 21787	
 21788	Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.
 21789	
 21790	--Haines is gone, he said.
 21791	
 21792	--Is he?
 21793	
 21794	--I was showing him Jubainville's book. He's quite enthusiastic, don't
 21795	you know, about Hyde's _Lovesongs of Connacht._ I couldn't bring him in
 21796	to hear the discussion. He's gone to Gill's to buy it.
 21797	
 21798	     _Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick
 21799	     To greet the callous public.
 21800	     Writ, I ween, 'twas not my wish
 21801	     In lean unlovely English._
 21802	
 21803	--The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.
 21804	
 21805	We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green
 21806	twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.
 21807	
 21808	--People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of
 21809	Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the
 21810	world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant's heart on the
 21811	hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the
 21812	living mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the
 21813	sixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flower
 21814	of corruption in Mallarme but the desirable life is revealed only to the
 21815	poor of heart, the life of Homer's Phaeacians.
 21816	
 21817	From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.
 21818	
 21819	--Mallarme, don't you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose
 21820	poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about
 21821	_Hamlet._ He says: _il se promÃ¨ne, lisant au livre de lui-mÃªme_, don't
 21822	you know, _reading the book of himself_. He describes _Hamlet_ given in
 21823	a French town, don't you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.
 21824	
 21825	His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.
 21826	
 21827	     _HAMLET
 21828	     ou
 21829	     LE DISTRAIT
 21830	     PiÃ¨ce de Shakespeare_
 21831	
 21832	He repeated to John Eglinton's newgathered frown:
 21833	
 21834	--_PiÃ¨ce de Shakespeare_, don't you know. It's so French. The French
 21835	point of view. _Hamlet ou_...
 21836	
 21837	--The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.
 21838	
 21839	John Eglinton laughed.
 21840	
 21841	--Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, but
 21842	distressingly shortsighted in some matters.
 21843	
 21844	Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.
 21845	
 21846	--A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not
 21847	for nothing was he a butcher's son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and
 21848	spitting in his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his father's one.
 21849	Our Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don't hesitate to
 21850	shoot. The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the
 21851	concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.
 21852	
 21853	Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.
 21854	
 21855	_Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none But we had spared..._
 21856	
 21857	Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.
 21858	
 21859	--He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said
 21860	for Mr Best's behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our
 21861	flesh creep.
 21862	
 21863	_List! List! O List!_
 21864	
 21865	My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.
 21866	
 21867	_If thou didst ever..._
 21868	
 21869	--What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded
 21870	into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of
 21871	manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris
 21872	lies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_, returning
 21873	to the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?
 21874	
 21875	John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.
 21876	
 21877	Lifted.
 21878	
 21879	--It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with
 21880	a swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the
 21881	bankside. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden.
 21882	Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the
 21883	groundlings.
 21884	
 21885	Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.
 21886	
 21887	--Shakespeare has left the huguenot's house in Silver street and walks
 21888	by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the
 21889	pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon
 21890	has other thoughts.
 21891	
 21892	Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!
 21893	
 21894	--The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the
 21895	castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the
 21896	ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who
 21897	has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in
 21898	order to play the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to Burbage,
 21899	the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth,
 21900	calling him by a name:
 21901	
 21902	_Hamlet, I am thy father's spirit,_
 21903	
 21904	bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,
 21905	young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has
 21906	died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.
 21907	
 21908	Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
 21909	the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
 21910	to his own son's name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been
 21911	prince Hamlet's twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that
 21912	he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you
 21913	are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the
 21914	guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?
 21915	
 21916	--But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began
 21917	impatiently.
 21918	
 21919	Art thou there, truepenny?
 21920	
 21921	--Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I
 21922	mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the
 21923	poet lived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de
 21924	l'Isle has said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day,
 21925	the poet's drinking, the poet's debts. We have _King Lear_: and it is
 21926	immortal.
 21927	
 21928	Mr Best's face, appealed to, agreed.
 21929	
 21930	_Flow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan, Mananaan
 21931	MacLir..._
 21932	
 21933	How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?
 21934	
 21935	Marry, I wanted it.
 21936	
 21937	Take thou this noble.
 21938	
 21939	Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson's bed, clergyman's
 21940	daughter. Agenbite of inwit.
 21941	
 21942	Do you intend to pay it back?
 21943	
 21944	O, yes.
 21945	
 21946	When? Now?
 21947	
 21948	Well... No.
 21949	
 21950	When, then?
 21951	
 21952	I paid my way. I paid my way.
 21953	
 21954	Steady on. He's from beyant Boyne water. The northeast corner. You owe
 21955	it.
 21956	
 21957	Wait. Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now. Other I got
 21958	pound.
 21959	
 21960	Buzz. Buzz.
 21961	
 21962	But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under
 21963	everchanging forms.
 21964	
 21965	I that sinned and prayed and fasted.
 21966	
 21967	A child Conmee saved from pandies.
 21968	
 21969	I, I and I. I.
 21970	
 21971	A.E.I.O.U.
 21972	
 21973	--Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?
 21974	John Eglinton's carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid
 21975	for ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.
 21976	
 21977	--She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She
 21978	saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She bore
 21979	his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed
 21980	when he lay on his deathbed.
 21981	
 21982	Mother's deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into
 21983	this world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. _Liliata
 21984	rutilantium._
 21985	
 21986	I wept alone.
 21987	
 21988	John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.
 21989	
 21990	--The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got
 21991	out of it as quickly and as best he could.
 21992	
 21993	--Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His
 21994	errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.
 21995	
 21996	Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,
 21997	softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.
 21998	
 21999	--A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of
 22000	discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn
 22001	from Xanthippe?
 22002	
 22003	--Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts
 22004	into the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit
 22005	nomen!_), Socratididion's Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever
 22006	know. But neither the midwife's lore nor the caudlelectures saved him
 22007	from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.
 22008	
 22009	--But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best's quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seem
 22010	to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.
 22011	
 22012	His look went from brooder's beard to carper's skull, to remind, to
 22013	chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless
 22014	though maligned.
 22015	
 22016	--He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.
 22017	He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling
 22018	_The girl I left behind me._ If the earthquake did not time it we should
 22019	know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds,
 22020	the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, _Venus and
 22021	Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London.
 22022	Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and
 22023	beautiful. Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a
 22024	passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose
 22025	the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her
 22026	and gained the world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy.
 22027	Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He
 22028	was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way.
 22029	By cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him, sweet and
 22030	twentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping
 22031	to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford
 22032	wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.
 22033	
 22034	And my turn? When?
 22035	
 22036	Come!
 22037	
 22038	--Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,
 22039	brightly.
 22040	
 22041	He murmured then with blond delight for all:
 22042	
 22043	_Between the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie._
 22044	
 22045	Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.
 22046	
 22047	A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its
 22048	cooperative watch.
 22049	
 22050	--I am afraid I am due at the _Homestead._
 22051	
 22052	Whither away? Exploitable ground.
 22053	
 22054	--Are you going? John Eglinton's active eyebrows asked. Shall we see you
 22055	at Moore's tonight? Piper is coming.
 22056	
 22057	--Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?
 22058	
 22059	Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.
 22060	
 22061	--I don't know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get
 22062	away in time.
 22063	
 22064	Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. _Isis Unveiled._ Their Pali book we
 22065	tried to pawn. Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an
 22066	Aztec logos, functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma.
 22067	The faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship,
 22068	ringroundabout him. Louis H. Victory. T. Caulfield Irwin. Lotus ladies
 22069	tend them i'the eyes, their pineal glands aglow. Filled with his god,
 22070	he thrones, Buddh under plantain. Gulfer of souls, engulfer. Hesouls,
 22071	shesouls, shoals of souls. Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled,
 22072	whirling, they bewail.
 22073	
 22074	     _In quintessential triviality
 22075	     For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt._
 22076	
 22077	--They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian
 22078	said, friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering
 22079	together a sheaf of our younger poets' verses. We are all looking
 22080	forward anxiously.
 22081	
 22082	Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces,
 22083	lighted, shone.
 22084	
 22085	See this. Remember.
 22086	
 22087	Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his
 22088	ashplanthandle over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly with
 22089	two index fingers. Aristotle's experiment. One or two? Necessity is that
 22090	in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise. Argal,
 22091	one hat is one hat.
 22092	
 22093	Listen.
 22094	
 22095	Young Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.
 22096	Longworth will give it a good puff in the _Express._ O, will he? I liked
 22097	Colum's _Drover._ Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do you
 22098	think he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: _As in wild earth
 22099	a Grecian vase_. Did he? I hope you'll be able to come tonight. Malachi
 22100	Mulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear
 22101	Miss Mitchell's joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyn's
 22102	wild oats? Awfully clever, isn't it? They remind one of Don Quixote and
 22103	Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says.
 22104	Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in
 22105	Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O'Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the
 22106	grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever
 22107	sketches. We are becoming important, it seems.
 22108	
 22109	Cordelia. _Cordoglio._ Lir's loneliest daughter.
 22110	
 22111	Nookshotten. Now your best French polish.
 22112	
 22113	--Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will be
 22114	so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...
 22115	
 22116	--O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so much
 22117	correspondence.
 22118	
 22119	--I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.
 22120	
 22121	God ild you. The pigs' paper. Bullockbefriending.
 22122	
 22123	Synge has promised me an article for _Dana_ too. Are we going to be
 22124	read? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope
 22125	you will come round tonight. Bring Starkey.
 22126	
 22127	Stephen sat down.
 22128	
 22129	The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his mask said:
 22130	
 22131	--Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.
 22132	
 22133	He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
 22134	chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:
 22135	
 22136	--Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?
 22137	
 22138	Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?
 22139	
 22140	--Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been
 22141	first a sundering.
 22142	
 22143	--Yes.
 22144	
 22145	Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,
 22146	from hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women
 22147	he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices,
 22148	bully tapsters' wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack
 22149	dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as
 22150	cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow
 22151	grave and unforgiven.
 22152	
 22153	--Yes. So you think...
 22154	
 22155	The door closed behind the outgoer.
 22156	
 22157	Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and
 22158	brooding air.
 22159	
 22160	A vestal's lamp.
 22161	
 22162	Here he ponders things that were not: what Caesar would have lived to do
 22163	had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of
 22164	the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when
 22165	he lived among women.
 22166	
 22167	Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.
 22168	Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the
 22169	voice of that Egyptian highpriest. _In painted chambers loaded with
 22170	tilebooks._
 22171	
 22172	They are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of
 22173	death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak
 22174	their will.
 22175	
 22176	--Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most
 22177	enigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so
 22178	much. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.
 22179	
 22180	--But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn't it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind
 22181	of private paper, don't you know, of his private life. I mean, I don't
 22182	care a button, don't you know, who is killed or who is guilty...
 22183	
 22184	He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his
 22185	defiance. His private papers in the original. _Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim
 22186	in mo shagart_. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.
 22187	
 22188	Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:
 22189	
 22190	--I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but
 22191	I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that
 22192	Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.
 22193	
 22194	Bear with me.
 22195	
 22196	Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under
 22197	wrinkled brows. A basilisk. _E quando vede l'uomo l'attosca_. Messer
 22198	Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.
 22199	
 22200	--As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,
 22201	from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist
 22202	weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where
 22203	it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff
 22204	time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image
 22205	of the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination,
 22206	when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that
 22207	which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. So in the
 22208	future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but
 22209	by reflection from that which then I shall be.
 22210	
 22211	Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.
 22212	
 22213	--Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness
 22214	might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from
 22215	the son.
 22216	
 22217	Has the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.
 22218	
 22219	--That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.
 22220	
 22221	John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.
 22222	
 22223	--If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a
 22224	drug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare's later years which Renan
 22225	admired so much breathe another spirit.
 22226	
 22227	--The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.
 22228	
 22229	--There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a
 22230	sundering.
 22231	
 22232	Said that.
 22233	
 22234	--If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over
 22235	the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,_
 22236	look to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a
 22237	man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,
 22238	prince of Tyre?
 22239	
 22240	Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.
 22241	
 22242	--A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.
 22243	
 22244	--The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant
 22245	quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead
 22246	to the town.
 22247	
 22248	Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon's wild oats. Cypherjugglers
 22249	going the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town, good
 22250	masters? Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the
 22251	sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n-og_. Booted the twain and staved.
 22252	
 22253	_How many miles to Dublin? Three score and ten, sir. Will we be there by
 22254	candlelight?_
 22255	
 22256	--Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing
 22257	period.
 22258	
 22259	--Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his
 22260	name is, say of it?
 22261	
 22262	--Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,
 22263	that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter's
 22264	child. _My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this maid._ Will any
 22265	man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?
 22266	
 22267	--The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. _l'art d'Ãªtre
 22268	grand_...
 22269	
 22270	--Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,
 22271	another image?
 22272	
 22273	Do you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all
 22274	men. Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus
 22275	...
 22276	
 22277	--His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of
 22278	all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The
 22279	images of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them
 22280	grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.
 22281	
 22282	The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.
 22283	
 22284	--I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of
 22285	the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George
 22286	Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles on
 22287	Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant. Oddly
 22288	enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the
 22289	sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own
 22290	that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in
 22291	harmony with--what shall I say?--our notions of what ought not to have
 22292	been.
 22293	
 22294	Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk's egg, prize
 22295	of their fray.
 22296	
 22297	He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost
 22298	love thy man?
 22299	
 22300	--That may be too, Stephen said. There's a saying of Goethe's which Mr
 22301	Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because
 22302	you will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is
 22303	a _buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a
 22304	scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord
 22305	of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written
 22306	_Romeo and Juliet_. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He
 22307	was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will
 22308	never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game
 22309	of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later
 22310	undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded
 22311	him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there
 22312	remains to her woman's invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words,
 22313	some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow
 22314	of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself. A like
 22315	fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.
 22316	
 22317	They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.
 22318	
 22319	--The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
 22320	porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot
 22321	know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls
 22322	with that knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast
 22323	with two backs that urged it King Hamlet's ghost could not know of were
 22324	he not endowed with knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech
 22325	(his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere, backward.
 22326	Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from
 22327	Lucrece's bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen's breast, bare, with its
 22328	mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up
 22329	to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But, because
 22330	loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished
 22331	personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he
 22332	has revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by
 22333	Elsinore's rocks or what you will, the sea's voice, a voice heard
 22334	only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son
 22335	consubstantial with the father.
 22336	
 22337	--Amen! was responded from the doorway.
 22338	
 22339	Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?
 22340	
 22341	_Entr'acte_.
 22342	
 22343	A ribald face, sullen as a dean's, Buck Mulligan came forward, then
 22344	blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.
 22345	
 22346	--You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he
 22347	asked of Stephen.
 22348	
 22349	Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.
 22350	
 22351	They make him welcome. _Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen._
 22352	
 22353	Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.
 22354	
 22355	He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself,
 22356	Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends,
 22357	stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on
 22358	crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven
 22359	and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His
 22360	Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead
 22361	when all the quick shall be dead already.
 22362	
 22363	Glo--o--ri--a in ex--cel--sis De--o.
 22364	
 22365	He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells
 22366	aquiring.
 22367	
 22368	--Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion.
 22369	Mr Mulligan, I'll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of
 22370	Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.
 22371	
 22372	He smiled on all sides equally.
 22373	
 22374	Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:
 22375	
 22376	--Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.
 22377	
 22378	A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.
 22379	
 22380	--To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like
 22381	Synge.
 22382	
 22383	Mr Best turned to him.
 22384	
 22385	--Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He'll see you after at
 22386	the D. B. C. He's gone to Gill's to buy Hyde's _Lovesongs of Connacht_.
 22387	
 22388	--I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?
 22389	
 22390	--The bard's fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired
 22391	perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played
 22392	Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining
 22393	held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an
 22394	Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He
 22395	swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.
 22396	
 22397	--The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde's, Mr Best said,
 22398	lifting his brilliant notebook. That _Portrait of Mr W. H._ where he
 22399	proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.
 22400	
 22401	--For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.
 22402	
 22403	Or Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?
 22404	
 22405	--I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of
 22406	course it's all paradox, don't you know, Hughes and hews and hues,
 22407	the colour, but it's so typical the way he works it out. It's the very
 22408	essence of Wilde, don't you know. The light touch.
 22409	
 22410	His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.
 22411	Tame essence of Wilde.
 22412	
 22413	You're darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan
 22414	Deasy's ducats.
 22415	
 22416	How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.
 22417	
 22418	For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.
 22419	
 22420	Wit. You would give your five wits for youth's proud livery he pranks
 22421	in. Lineaments of gratified desire.
 22422	
 22423	There be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool ruttime
 22424	send them. Yea, turtledove her.
 22425	
 22426	Eve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in's kiss.
 22427	
 22428	--Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking.
 22429	The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.
 22430	
 22431	They talked seriously of mocker's seriousness.
 22432	
 22433	Buck Mulligan's again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head
 22434	wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His
 22435	mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.
 22436	
 22437	--Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!
 22438	
 22439	He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:
 22440	
 22441	--_The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the
 22442	immense debtorship for a thing done._ Signed: Dedalus. Where did you
 22443	launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four
 22444	quid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram!
 22445	Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer!
 22446	O, you priestified Kinchite!
 22447	
 22448	Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a
 22449	querulous brogue:
 22450	
 22451	--It's what I'm telling you, mister honey, it's queer and sick we were,
 22452	Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. 'Twas murmur we did
 22453	for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I'm thinking, and he limp with
 22454	leching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery's
 22455	sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.
 22456	
 22457	He wailed:
 22458	
 22459	--And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your
 22460	conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the
 22461	drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.
 22462	
 22463	Stephen laughed.
 22464	
 22465	Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.
 22466	
 22467	--The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He
 22468	heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He's out in pampooties to
 22469	murder you.
 22470	
 22471	--Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.
 22472	
 22473	Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping
 22474	ceiling.
 22475	
 22476	--Murder you! he laughed.
 22477	
 22478	Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash
 22479	of lights in rue Saint-AndrÃ©-des-Arts. In words of words for words,
 22480	palabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods,
 22481	brandishing a winebottle. _C'est vendredi saint!_ Murthering Irish. His
 22482	image, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i'the forest.
 22483	
 22484	--Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.
 22485	
 22486	--... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his
 22487	_Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms... Yes?
 22488	What is it?
 22489	
 22490	--There's a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and
 22491	offering a card. From the _Freeman._ He wants to see the files of the
 22492	_Kilkenny People_ for last year.
 22493	
 22494	--Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...
 22495	
 22496	He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked,
 22497	asked, creaked, asked:
 22498	
 22499	--Is he?... O, there!
 22500	
 22501	Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked
 22502	with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most
 22503	honest broadbrim.
 22504	
 22505	--This gentleman? _Freeman's Journal? Kilkenny People?_ To be sure. Good
 22506	day, sir. _Kilkenny_... We have certainly...
 22507	
 22508	A patient silhouette waited, listening.
 22509	
 22510	--All the leading provincial... _Northern Whig, Cork Examiner,
 22511	Enniscorthy Guardian,_ 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this
 22512	gentleman... If you just follow the atten... Or, please allow me...
 22513	This way... Please, sir...
 22514	
 22515	Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing
 22516	dark figure following his hasty heels.
 22517	
 22518	The door closed.
 22519	
 22520	--The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.
 22521	
 22522	He jumped up and snatched the card.
 22523	
 22524	--What's his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.
 22525	
 22526	He rattled on:
 22527	
 22528	--Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the
 22529	museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that
 22530	has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her.
 22531	_Life of life, thy lips enkindle._
 22532	
 22533	Suddenly he turned to Stephen:
 22534	
 22535	--He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker
 22536	than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.
 22537	Venus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the
 22538	maiden hid_.
 22539	
 22540	--We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's approval.
 22541	We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if
 22542	at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.
 22543	
 22544	--Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty
 22545	from Kyrios Menelaus' brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy
 22546	in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty
 22547	years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary
 22548	equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His
 22549	art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the
 22550	art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar
 22551	of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter
 22552	Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his
 22553	back including a pair of fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had
 22554	underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied
 22555	there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love
 22556	and its foul pleasures. You know Manningham's story of the burgher's
 22557	wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard
 22558	III_ and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing,
 22559	took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate,
 22560	answered from the capon's blankets: _William the conqueror came before
 22561	Richard III_. And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O,
 22562	and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is
 22563	suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.
 22564	
 22565	Cours la Reine. _Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites cochonneries.
 22566	Minette? Tu veux?_
 22567	
 22568	--The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of oxford's
 22569	mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.
 22570	
 22571	Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:
 22572	
 22573	--Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!
 22574	
 22575	--And Harry of six wives' daughter. And other lady friends from
 22576	neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those
 22577	twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing
 22578	behind the diamond panes?
 22579	
 22580	Do and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist,
 22581	he walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of
 22582	Juno's eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.
 22583	Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.
 22584	
 22585	Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton's desk sharply.
 22586	
 22587	--Whom do you suspect? he challenged.
 22588	
 22589	--Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice
 22590	spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.
 22591	
 22592	Love that dare not speak its name.
 22593	
 22594	--As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a
 22595	lord.
 22596	
 22597	Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.
 22598	
 22599	--It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all
 22600	other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the
 22601	stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a
 22602	shrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two
 22603	deeds are rank in that ghost's mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained
 22604	yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband's brother. Sweet
 22605	Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer, twice a wooer.
 22606	
 22607	Stephen turned boldly in his chair.
 22608	
 22609	--The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If you
 22610	deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy
 22611	tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years
 22612	between the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those
 22613	women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her
 22614	poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the
 22615	first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her
 22616	sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan's daughter, Elizabeth, to use
 22617	granddaddy's words, wed her second, having killed her first.
 22618	
 22619	O, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in
 22620	royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her
 22621	father's shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he
 22622	has commended her to posterity.
 22623	
 22624	He faced their silence.
 22625	
 22626	     To whom thus Eglinton:
 22627	     You mean the will.
 22628	     But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.
 22629	     She was entitled to her widow's dower
 22630	     At common law. His legal knowledge was great
 22631	     Our judges tell us.
 22632	     Him Satan fleers,
 22633	     Mocker:
 22634	     And therefore he left out her name
 22635	     From the first draft but he did not leave out
 22636	     The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,
 22637	     For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford
 22638	     And in London. And therefore when he was urged,
 22639	     As I believe, to name her
 22640	     He left her his
 22641	     Secondbest
 22642	     Bed.
 22643	     _Punkt._
 22644	     Leftherhis
 22645	     Secondbest
 22646	     Leftherhis
 22647	     Bestabed
 22648	     Secabest
 22649	     Leftabed.
 22650	
 22651	
 22652	Woa!
 22653	
 22654	--Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as
 22655	they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.
 22656	
 22657	--He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms
 22658	and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist
 22659	shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her
 22660	his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in
 22661	peace?
 22662	
 22663	--It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr
 22664	Secondbest Best said finely.
 22665	
 22666	--_Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was
 22667	smiled on.
 22668	
 22669	--Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.
 22670	Let me think.
 22671	
 22672	--Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,
 22673	Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays
 22674	tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his
 22675	dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don't forget
 22676	Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.
 22677	
 22678	--Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean...
 22679	
 22680	--He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for
 22681	a king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!
 22682	
 22683	--What? asked Besteglinton.
 22684	
 22685	William Shakespeare and company, limited. The people's William. For
 22686	terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house...
 22687	
 22688	--Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought
 22689	of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his hands
 22690	and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those days._
 22691	Lovely!
 22692	
 22693	Catamite.
 22694	
 22695	--The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to
 22696	ugling Eglinton.
 22697	
 22698	Steadfast John replied severe:
 22699	
 22700	--The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cake
 22701	and have it.
 22702	
 22703	Sayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?
 22704	
 22705	--And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his
 22706	own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself
 22707	a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the
 22708	famine riots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship
 22709	mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.
 22710	He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted
 22711	his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. How else could
 22712	Aubrey's ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to
 22713	his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging
 22714	and quartering of the queen's leech Lopez, his jew's heart being plucked
 22715	forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with
 22716	the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for
 22717	witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in _Love's Labour Lost_.
 22718	His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking
 22719	enthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter's theory
 22720	of equivocation. The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and the play
 22721	Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin.
 22722	The sugared sonnets follow Sidney's. As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise
 22723	carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives of
 22724	Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid
 22725	meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.
 22726	
 22727	I think you're getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of
 22728	theolologicophilolological. _Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere._
 22729	
 22730	--Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared,'expectantly. Your dean
 22731	of studies holds he was a holy Roman.
 22732	
 22733	_Sufflaminandus sum._
 22734	
 22735	--He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French
 22736	polisher of Italian scandals.
 22737	
 22738	--A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him
 22739	myriadminded.
 22740	
 22741	_Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia
 22742	inter multos._
 22743	
 22744	--Saint Thomas, Stephen began...
 22745	
 22746	--_Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.
 22747	
 22748	There he keened a wailing rune.
 22749	
 22750	--_Pogue mahone! Acushla machree!_ It's destroyed we are from this day!
 22751	It's destroyed we are surely!
 22752	
 22753	All smiled their smiles.
 22754	
 22755	--Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy
 22756	reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different
 22757	from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his
 22758	wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that the
 22759	love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some
 22760	stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with
 22761	avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. Accusations
 22762	are made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the
 22763	jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their
 22764	affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues old
 22765	Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so tightly
 22766	to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold
 22767	tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his
 22768	wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his
 22769	manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.
 22770	
 22771	--Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.
 22772	
 22773	--Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.
 22774	
 22775	--Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.
 22776	
 22777	--The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will's
 22778	widow, is the will to die.
 22779	
 22780	_--Requiescat!_ Stephen prayed.
 22781	
 22782	     _What of all the will to do?
 22783	     It has vanished long ago..._
 22784	
 22785	--She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the
 22786	mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as
 22787	rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven
 22788	parishes. In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her
 22789	at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in
 22790	which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul. She
 22791	read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the _Merry
 22792	Wives_ and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she thought
 22793	over _Hooks and Eyes for Believers' Breeches_ and _The most Spiritual
 22794	Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze_. Venus has twisted her
 22795	lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience. It is an age
 22796	of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.
 22797	
 22798	--History shows that to be true, _inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos_. The
 22799	ages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man's
 22800	worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that
 22801	Russell is right. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say
 22802	that only family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man.
 22803	I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.
 22804	
 22805	Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping
 22806	with the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it
 22807	him. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there's a gentleman
 22808	to see you. Me? Says he's your father, sir. Give me my Wordsworth. Enter
 22809	Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with
 22810	a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten
 22811	forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.
 22812	
 22813	Your own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.
 22814	
 22815	Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I
 22816	touched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is
 22817	attending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.
 22818	
 22819	--A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary
 22820	evil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father's death.
 22821	If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with
 22822	thirtyfive years of life, _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_, with
 22823	fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then
 22824	you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No.
 22825	The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night. From hour to
 22826	hour it rots and rots. He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised
 22827	that mystical estate upon his son. Boccaccio's Calandrino was the first
 22828	and last man who felt himself with child. Fatherhood, in the sense of
 22829	conscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is a mystical estate, an
 22830	apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. On that
 22831	mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect
 22832	flung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably
 22833	because founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void.
 22834	Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood. _Amor matris_, subjective and
 22835	objective genitive, may be the only true thing in life. Paternity may be
 22836	a legal fiction. Who is the father of any son that any son should love
 22837	him or he any son?
 22838	
 22839	What the hell are you driving at?
 22840	
 22841	I know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.
 22842	
 22843	_Amplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea._
 22844	
 22845	Are you condemned to do this?
 22846	
 22847	--They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal
 22848	annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,
 22849	hardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters,
 22850	lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with
 22851	grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son
 22852	unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases
 22853	care. He is a new male: his growth is his father's decline, his youth
 22854	his father's envy, his friend his father's enemy.
 22855	
 22856	In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.
 22857	
 22858	--What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.
 22859	
 22860	Am I a father? If I were?
 22861	
 22862	Shrunken uncertain hand.
 22863	
 22864	--Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the
 22865	field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of
 22866	Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if
 22867	the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a
 22868	father be a son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet
 22869	of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not the
 22870	father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt
 22871	himself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather,
 22872	the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was
 22873	born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.
 22874	
 22875	Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladly
 22876	glancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.
 22877	
 22878	Flatter. Rarely. But flatter.
 22879	
 22880	--Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big with
 22881	child. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! The
 22882	play's the thing! Let me parturiate!
 22883	
 22884	He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.
 22885	
 22886	--As for his family, Stephen said, his mother's name lives in the
 22887	forest of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in
 22888	_Coriolanus._ His boyson's death is the deathscene of young Arthur in
 22889	_King John._ Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the
 22890	girls in _The Tempest_, in _Pericles,_ in _Winter's Tale_ are we know.
 22891	Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may
 22892	guess. But there is another member of his family who is recorded.
 22893	
 22894	--The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.
 22895	
 22896	The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with
 22897	haste, quake, quack.
 22898	
 22899	Door closed. Cell. Day.
 22900	
 22901	They list. Three. They.
 22902	
 22903	I you he they.
 22904	
 22905	Come, mess.
 22906	
 22907	STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in his
 22908	old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister Gatherer
 22909	one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter up
 22910	in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on's back. The playhouse sausage
 22911	filled Gilbert's soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard are
 22912	recorded in the works of sweet William.
 22913	
 22914	MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What's in a name?
 22915	
 22916	BEST: That is my name, Richard, don't you know. I hope you are going to
 22917	say a good word for Richard, don't you know, for my sake. _(Laughter)_
 22918	
 22919	
 22920	BUCKMULLIGAN: (_Piano, diminuendo_)
 22921	
 22922	     _Then outspoke medical Dick
 22923	     To his comrade medical Davy..._
 22924	
 22925	STEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago,
 22926	Richard Crookback, Edmund in _King Lear_, two bear the wicked uncles'
 22927	names. Nay, that last play was written or being written while his
 22928	brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.
 22929	
 22930	BEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it. I don't want Richard, my name
 22931	...
 22932	
 22933	_(Laughter)_
 22934	
 22935	QUAKERLYSTER: (_A tempo_) But he that filches from me my good name...
 22936	
 22937	STEPHEN: _(Stringendo)_ He has hidden his own name, a fair name,
 22938	William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old
 22939	Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it in
 22940	the sonnets where there is Will in overplus. Like John o'Gaunt his name
 22941	is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a bend
 22942	sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer
 22943	than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country. What's in a name?
 22944	That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that
 22945	we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth.
 22946	It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the
 22947	night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent
 22948	constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars. His
 22949	eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as
 22950	he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from
 22951	Shottery and from her arms.
 22952	
 22953	Both satisfied. I too.
 22954	
 22955	Don't tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.
 22956	
 22957	And from her arms.
 22958	
 22959	Wait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?
 22960	
 22961	Read the skies. _Autontimorumenos. Bous Stephanoumenos._ Where's your
 22962	configuration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S. D: _sua donna.
 22963	GiÃ : di lui. gelindo risolve di non amare_ S. D.
 22964	
 22965	--What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a
 22966	celestial phenomenon?
 22967	
 22968	--A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.
 22969	
 22970	What more's to speak?
 22971	
 22972	Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.
 22973	
 22974	_Stephanos,_ my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my
 22975	feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.
 22976	
 22977	--You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own name is
 22978	strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.
 22979	
 22980	Me, Magee and Mulligan.
 22981	
 22982	Fabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto?
 22983	Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus.
 22984	_Pater, ait._ Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing
 22985	be.
 22986	
 22987	Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:
 22988	
 22989	--That's very interesting because that brother motive, don't you know,
 22990	we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three
 22991	brothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don't you know, the fairytales. The
 22992	third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best
 22993	prize.
 22994	
 22995	Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.
 22996	
 22997	The quaker librarian springhalted near.
 22998	
 22999	--I should like to know, he said, which brother you... I understand you
 23000	to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... But perhaps
 23001	I am anticipating?
 23002	
 23003	He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.
 23004	
 23005	An attendant from the doorway called:
 23006	
 23007	--Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...
 23008	
 23009	--O, Father Dineen! Directly.
 23010	
 23011	Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.
 23012	
 23013	John Eglinton touched the foil.
 23014	
 23015	--Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.
 23016	You kept them for the last, didn't you?
 23017	
 23018	--In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and
 23019	nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A
 23020	brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.
 23021	
 23022	Lapwing.
 23023	
 23024	Where is your brother? Apothecaries' hall. My whetstone. Him, then
 23025	Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They
 23026	mock to try you. Act. Be acted on.
 23027	
 23028	Lapwing.
 23029	
 23030	I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.
 23031	
 23032	On.
 23033	
 23034	--You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he
 23035	took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others?
 23036	Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann
 23037	(what's in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard
 23038	the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The
 23039	other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his
 23040	kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare's reverence,
 23041	the angel of the world. Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which
 23042	Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney's _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to a
 23043	Celtic legend older than history?
 23044	
 23045	--That was Will's way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine
 23046	a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. _Que
 23047	voulez-vous?_ Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes
 23048	Ulysses quote Aristotle.
 23049	
 23050	--Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or
 23051	the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to
 23052	Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of
 23053	banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds
 23054	uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero
 23055	breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his
 23056	book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in
 23057	another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.
 23058	It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married
 23059	daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it
 23060	was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will
 23061	and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of
 23062	my lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin,
 23063	committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the
 23064	lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under
 23065	which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it. Beauty
 23066	and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety everywhere in
 23067	the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_, twice in _As you
 23068	like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet,_ in _Measure for Measure_--and
 23069	in all the other plays which I have not read.
 23070	
 23071	He laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage.
 23072	
 23073	Judge Eglinton summed up.
 23074	
 23075	--The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He
 23076	is all in all.
 23077	
 23078	--He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.
 23079	All in all. In _Cymbeline,_ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold. He acts
 23080	and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jose he
 23081	kills the real Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago
 23082	ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.
 23083	
 23084	--Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!
 23085	
 23086	Dark dome received, reverbed.
 23087	
 23088	--And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. When
 23089	all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _pÃ¨re?)_ is right. After God
 23090	Shakespeare has created most.
 23091	
 23092	--Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after
 23093	a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has
 23094	always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of
 23095	life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The
 23096	motion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet _(pÃ¨re?)_ and Hamlet _fils._
 23097	A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what
 23098	though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for,
 23099	Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom
 23100	they refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it:
 23101	prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa's lump of
 23102	love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the
 23103	place where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world
 23104	without as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck
 23105	says: _If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated
 23106	on his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps
 23107	will tend._ Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through
 23108	ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives,
 23109	widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright
 23110	who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light
 23111	first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom
 23112	the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless
 23113	all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and
 23114	cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there
 23115	are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife
 23116	unto himself.
 23117	
 23118	_--Eureka!_ Buck Mulligan cried. _Eureka!_
 23119	
 23120	Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton's
 23121	desk.
 23122	
 23123	--May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.
 23124	
 23125	He began to scribble on a slip of paper.
 23126	
 23127	Take some slips from the counter going out.
 23128	
 23129	--Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one,
 23130	shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.
 23131	
 23132	He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.
 23133	
 23134	Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his
 23135	variorum edition of _The Taming of the Shrew._
 23136	
 23137	--You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have
 23138	brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe
 23139	your own theory?
 23140	
 23141	--No, Stephen said promptly.
 23142	
 23143	--Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a
 23144	dialogue, don't you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.
 23145	
 23146	John Eclecticon doubly smiled.
 23147	
 23148	--Well, in that case, he said, I don't see why you should expect payment
 23149	for it since you don't believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is
 23150	some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man
 23151	Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes
 23152	that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to
 23153	visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor
 23154	wrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he
 23155	believes his theory.
 23156	
 23157	I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help
 23158	me to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? _Egomen._ Who to unbelieve? Other
 23159	chap.
 23160	
 23161	--You are the only contributor to _Dana_ who asks for pieces of silver.
 23162	Then I don't know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an
 23163	article on economics.
 23164	
 23165	Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.
 23166	
 23167	--For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.
 23168	
 23169	Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then
 23170	gravely said, honeying malice:
 23171	
 23172	--I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper
 23173	Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra
 23174	Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and
 23175	Rosalie, the coalquay whore.
 23176	
 23177	He broke away.
 23178	
 23179	--Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Aengus of the birds.
 23180	
 23181	Come, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts
 23182	and offals.
 23183	
 23184	Stephen rose.
 23185	
 23186	Life is many days. This will end.
 23187	
 23188	--We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. _Notre ami_ Moore says
 23189	Malachi Mulligan must be there.
 23190	
 23191	Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.
 23192	
 23193	--Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of
 23194	Ireland. I'll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk
 23195	straight?
 23196	
 23197	Laughing, he...
 23198	
 23199	Swill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.
 23200	
 23201	Lubber...
 23202	
 23203	Stephen followed a lubber...
 23204	
 23205	One day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After. His
 23206	lub back: I followed. I gall his kibe.
 23207	
 23208	Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt
 23209	head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of
 23210	no thought.
 23211	
 23212	What have I learned? Of them? Of me?
 23213	
 23214	Walk like Haines now.
 23215	
 23216	The constant readers' room. In the readers' book Cashel Boyle O'Connor
 23217	Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet
 23218	mad? The quaker's pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.
 23219	
 23220	--O please do, sir... I shall be most pleased...
 23221	
 23222	Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:
 23223	
 23224	--A pleased bottom.
 23225	
 23226	The turnstile.
 23227	
 23228	Is that?... Blueribboned hat... Idly writing... What? Looked?...
 23229	
 23230	The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.
 23231	
 23232	Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:
 23233	
 23234	_John Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won't you wed a wife?_
 23235	
 23236	He spluttered to the air:
 23237	
 23238	--O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over to their
 23239	playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers' hall. Our players are creating a
 23240	new art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey Theatre! I
 23241	smell the pubic sweat of monks.
 23242	
 23243	He spat blank.
 23244	
 23245	Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And
 23246	left the _femme de trente ans._ And why no other children born? And his
 23247	first child a girl?
 23248	
 23249	Afterwit. Go back.
 23250	
 23251	The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling,
 23252	minion of pleasure, Phedo's toyable fair hair.
 23253	
 23254	Eh... I just eh... wanted... I forgot... he...
 23255	
 23256	--Longworth and M'Curdy Atkinson were there...
 23257	
 23258	Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:
 23259	
 23260	     _I hardly hear the purlieu cry
 23261	     Or a tommy talk as I pass one by
 23262	     Before my thoughts begin to run
 23263	     On F. M'Curdy Atkinson,
 23264	     The same that had the wooden leg
 23265	     And that filibustering filibeg
 23266	     That never dared to slake his drouth,
 23267	     Magee that had the chinless mouth.
 23268	     Being afraid to marry on earth
 23269	     They masturbated for all they were worth._
 23270	
 23271	
 23272	Jest on. Know thyself.
 23273	
 23274	Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.
 23275	
 23276	--Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing
 23277	black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.
 23278	
 23279	A laugh tripped over his lips.
 23280	
 23281	--Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that
 23282	old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you
 23283	a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.
 23284	Couldn't you do the Yeats touch?
 23285	
 23286	He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:
 23287	
 23288	--The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.
 23289	One thinks of Homer.
 23290	
 23291	He stopped at the stairfoot.
 23292	
 23293	--I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.
 23294	
 23295	The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men's morrice
 23296	with caps of indices.
 23297	
 23298	In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: _Everyman His
 23299	own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three
 23300	orgasms) by Ballocky Mulligan._
 23301	
 23302	
 23303	He turned a happy patch's smirk to Stephen, saying:
 23304	
 23305	--The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.
 23306	
 23307	He read, _marcato:_
 23308	
 23309	--Characters:
 23310	
 23311	     TODY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)
 23312	     CRAB (a bushranger)
 23313	     MEDICAL DICK )
 23314	     and          ) (two birds with one stone)
 23315	     MEDICAL DAVY )
 23316	     MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)
 23317	     FRESH NELLY
 23318	     and
 23319	     ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).
 23320	
 23321	He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:
 23322	and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:
 23323	
 23324	--O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to
 23325	lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,
 23326	multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!
 23327	
 23328	--The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted
 23329	them.
 23330	
 23331	About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.
 23332	
 23333	Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today,
 23334	if Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must
 23335	come to, ineluctably.
 23336	
 23337	My will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.
 23338	
 23339	A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.
 23340	
 23341	--Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.
 23342	
 23343	The portico.
 23344	
 23345	Here I watched the birds for augury. Aengus of the birds. They go, they
 23346	come. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots
 23347	after. A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.
 23348	
 23349	--The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown's awe. Did you
 23350	see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient
 23351	mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.
 23352	
 23353	Manner of Oxenford.
 23354	
 23355	Day. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.
 23356	
 23357	A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway,
 23358	under portcullis barbs.
 23359	
 23360	They followed.
 23361	
 23362	Offend me still. Speak on.
 23363	
 23364	Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail
 23365	from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw
 23366	of softness softly were blown.
 23367	
 23368	Cease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic:
 23369	from wide earth an altar.
 23370	
 23371	     _Laud we the gods
 23372	     And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
 23373	     From our bless'd altars._
 23374	
 23375	
 23376	The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. reset his smooth watch
 23377	in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to
 23378	three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy's name again?
 23379	Dignam. Yes. _Vere dignum et iustum est._ Brother Swan was the person
 23380	to see. Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good
 23381	practical catholic: useful at mission time.
 23382	
 23383	A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his
 23384	crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the
 23385	sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very
 23386	reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his
 23387	purse held, he knew, one silver crown.
 23388	
 23389	Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long,
 23390	of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,
 23391	ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words:
 23392	_If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have
 23393	abandoned me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking
 23394	leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.
 23395	
 23396	--Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?
 23397	
 23398	Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton
 23399	probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at
 23400	Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.
 23401	And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to
 23402	be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was
 23403	very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O,
 23404	yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.
 23405	
 23406	Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.
 23407	Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P.
 23408	Yes, he would certainly call.
 23409	
 23410	--Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.
 23411	
 23412	Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the
 23413	jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again,
 23414	in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.
 23415	
 23416	Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father
 23417	Bernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice.
 23418	
 23419	--Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob?
 23420	
 23421	A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his
 23422	way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.
 23423	Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?
 23424	
 23425	O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.
 23426	
 23427	Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy
 23428	square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were
 23429	they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his
 23430	name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man?
 23431	His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.
 23432	
 23433	Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and
 23434	pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.
 23435	
 23436	--But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said.
 23437	
 23438	The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:
 23439	
 23440	--O, sir.
 23441	
 23442	--Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.
 23443	
 23444	Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter
 23445	to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father
 23446	Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square
 23447	east.
 23448	
 23449	Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate
 23450	frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender
 23451	trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave
 23452	deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady
 23453	Maxwell at the corner of Dignam's court.
 23454	
 23455	Was that not Mrs M'Guinness?
 23456	
 23457	Mrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the
 23458	farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and
 23459	saluted. How did she do?
 23460	
 23461	A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to
 23462	think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he
 23463	say?... such a queenly mien.
 23464	
 23465	Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup
 23466	free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will (D.V.)
 23467	speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say
 23468	a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They
 23469	acted according to their lights.
 23470	
 23471	Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular
 23472	road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important
 23473	thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.
 23474	
 23475	A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All
 23476	raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.
 23477	Christian brother boys.
 23478	
 23479	Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint
 23480	Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females.
 23481	Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but
 23482	occasionally they were also badtempered.
 23483	
 23484	Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift
 23485	nobleman. And now it was an office or something.
 23486	
 23487	Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted
 23488	by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father
 23489	Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came
 23490	from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the
 23491	Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful
 23492	catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually
 23493	happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an
 23494	act of perfect contrition.
 23495	
 23496	Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of
 23497	which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.
 23498	
 23499	Father Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny
 23500	Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.
 23501	A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted
 23502	the constable. In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee
 23503	observed pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in
 23504	tubes.
 23505	
 23506	Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a
 23507	turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty
 23508	straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above
 23509	him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of
 23510	the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it
 23511	out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor
 23512	people.
 23513	
 23514	On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. of saint Francis
 23515	Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound
 23516	tram.
 23517	
 23518	Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of
 23519	saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.
 23520	
 23521	At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for
 23522	he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.
 23523	
 23524	Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with
 23525	care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence
 23526	and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.
 23527	Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually
 23528	made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The
 23529	solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive
 23530	for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.
 23531	
 23532	It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father
 23533	Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee
 23534	supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with
 23535	the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently,
 23536	tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily,
 23537	sweetly.
 23538	
 23539	Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that
 23540	the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the
 23541	seat.
 23542	
 23543	Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the
 23544	mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.
 23545	
 23546	At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old
 23547	woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the
 23548	bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and
 23549	a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and
 23550	basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed
 23551	the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had
 23552	always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been
 23553	absolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many
 23554	cares, poor creatures.
 23555	
 23556	From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at
 23557	Father Conmee.
 23558	
 23559	Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and
 23560	of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African mission and of
 23561	the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and
 23562	yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last
 23563	hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit,
 23564	_Le Nombre des Ãlus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those
 23565	were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to
 23566	whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were God's souls,
 23567	created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all
 23568	be lost, a waste, if one might say.
 23569	
 23570	At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the
 23571	conductor and saluted in his turn.
 23572	
 23573	The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.
 23574	The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide,
 23575	immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.
 23576	Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.
 23577	Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times
 23578	in the barony.
 23579	
 23580	Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the
 23581	Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of
 23582	Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.
 23583	
 23584	A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,
 23585	Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,
 23586	not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the
 23587	jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed
 23588	adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with
 23589	her husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned
 23590	as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother.
 23591	
 23592	Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for
 23593	man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.
 23594	
 23595	Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and
 23596	honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at
 23597	smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit
 23598	clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,
 23599	were impalmed by Don John Conmee.
 23600	
 23601	It was a charming day.
 23602	
 23603	The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,
 23604	curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of
 23605	small white clouds going slowly down the wind. _Moutonner,_ the French
 23606	said. A just and homely word.
 23607	
 23608	Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds
 23609	over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of
 23610	Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard
 23611	the cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet
 23612	evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.
 23613	
 23614	Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An
 23615	ivory bookmark told him the page.
 23616	
 23617	Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.
 23618	
 23619	Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.
 23620	_Deus in adiutorium._
 23621	
 23622	He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he
 23623	came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas:
 23624	in eternum omnia indicia iustitiae tuae._
 23625	
 23626	A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a
 23627	young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised
 23628	his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care
 23629	detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.
 23630	
 23631	Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his
 23632	breviary. _Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis
 23633	formidavit cor meum._
 23634	
 23635	* * * * *
 23636	
 23637	Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye
 23638	at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect,
 23639	went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
 23640	furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came
 23641	to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes
 23642	and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.
 23643	
 23644	Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.
 23645	
 23646	Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat
 23647	downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.
 23648	
 23649	Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.
 23650	
 23651	--That's a fine day, Mr Kelleher.
 23652	
 23653	--Ay, Corny Kelleher said.
 23654	
 23655	--It's very close, the constable said.
 23656	
 23657	Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth
 23658	while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a
 23659	coin.
 23660	
 23661	--What's the best news? he asked.
 23662	
 23663	--I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with
 23664	bated breath.
 23665	
 23666	* * * * *
 23667	
 23668	A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell's corner, skirting
 23669	Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards
 23670	Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:
 23671	
 23672	--_For England_...
 23673	
 23674	He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted
 23675	and growled:
 23676	
 23677	--_home and beauty._
 23678	
 23679	J. J. O'Molloy's white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the
 23680	warehouse with a visitor.
 23681	
 23682	A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it
 23683	into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly
 23684	at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four
 23685	strides.
 23686	
 23687	He halted and growled angrily:
 23688	
 23689	--_For England_...
 23690	
 23691	Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,
 23692	gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.
 23693	
 23694	He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head
 23695	towards a window and bayed deeply:
 23696	
 23697	--_home and beauty._
 23698	
 23699	The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.
 23700	The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card _Unfurnished Apartments_
 23701	slipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was
 23702	seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A
 23703	woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the
 23704	path.
 23705	
 23706	One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the
 23707	minstrel's cap, saying:
 23708	
 23709	--There, sir.
 23710	
 23711	* * * * *
 23712	
 23713	Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.
 23714	
 23715	--Did you put in the books? Boody asked.
 23716	
 23717	Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds
 23718	twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.
 23719	
 23720	--They wouldn't give anything on them, she said.
 23721	
 23722	Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles
 23723	tickled by stubble.
 23724	
 23725	--Where did you try? Boody asked.
 23726	
 23727	--M'Guinness's.
 23728	
 23729	Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.
 23730	
 23731	--Bad cess to her big face! she cried.
 23732	
 23733	Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.
 23734	
 23735	--What's in the pot? she asked.
 23736	
 23737	--Shirts, Maggy said.
 23738	
 23739	Boody cried angrily:
 23740	
 23741	--Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?
 23742	
 23743	Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:
 23744	
 23745	--And what's in this?
 23746	
 23747	A heavy fume gushed in answer.
 23748	
 23749	--Peasoup, Maggy said.
 23750	
 23751	--Where did you get it? Katey asked.
 23752	
 23753	--Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.
 23754	
 23755	The lacquey rang his bell.
 23756	
 23757	--Barang!
 23758	
 23759	Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:
 23760	
 23761	--Give us it here.
 23762	
 23763	Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey,
 23764	sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her
 23765	mouth random crumbs:
 23766	
 23767	--A good job we have that much. Where's Dilly?
 23768	
 23769	--Gone to meet father, Maggy said.
 23770	
 23771	Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:
 23772	
 23773	--Our father who art not in heaven.
 23774	
 23775	Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey's bowl, exclaimed:
 23776	
 23777	--Boody! For shame!
 23778	
 23779	A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the
 23780	Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed
 23781	around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,
 23782	between the Customhouse old dock and George's quay.
 23783	
 23784	* * * * *
 23785	
 23786	The blond girl in Thornton's bedded the wicker basket with rustling
 23787	fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper
 23788	and a small jar.
 23789	
 23790	--Put these in first, will you? he said.
 23791	
 23792	--Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.
 23793	
 23794	--That'll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.
 23795	
 23796	She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe
 23797	shamefaced peaches.
 23798	
 23799	Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the
 23800	fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red
 23801	tomatoes, sniffing smells.
 23802	
 23803	H. E. L. Y.'S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane,
 23804	plodding towards their goal.
 23805	
 23806	He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from
 23807	his fob and held it at its chain's length.
 23808	
 23809	--Can you send them by tram? Now?
 23810	
 23811	A darkbacked figure under Merchants' arch scanned books on the hawker's
 23812	cart.
 23813	
 23814	--Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?
 23815	
 23816	--O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.
 23817	
 23818	The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.
 23819	
 23820	--Will you write the address, sir?
 23821	
 23822	Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.
 23823	
 23824	--Send it at once, will you? he said. It's for an invalid.
 23825	
 23826	--Yes, sir. I will, sir.
 23827	
 23828	Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers' pocket.
 23829	
 23830	--What's the damage? he asked.
 23831	
 23832	The blond girl's slim fingers reckoned the fruits.
 23833	
 23834	Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took
 23835	a red carnation from the tall stemglass.
 23836	
 23837	--This for me? he asked gallantly.
 23838	
 23839	The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie
 23840	a bit crooked, blushing.
 23841	
 23842	--Yes, sir, she said.
 23843	
 23844	Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.
 23845	
 23846	Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the
 23847	red flower between his smiling teeth.
 23848	
 23849	--May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.
 23850	
 23851	* * * * *
 23852	
 23853	_--Ma!_ Almidano Artifoni said.
 23854	
 23855	He gazed over Stephen's shoulder at Goldsmith's knobby poll.
 23856	
 23857	Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore,
 23858	gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men's arms frankly round their
 23859	stunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of
 23860	the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.
 23861	
 23862	--_Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee, ALMIDANO ARTIFONI SAID, quand' ero
 23863	giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo Ã¨ una bestia.
 23864	Ã peccato. PerchÃ¨ la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.
 23865	Invece, Lei si sacrifica._
 23866	
 23867	--_Sacrifizio incruento,_ Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in
 23868	slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.
 23869	
 23870	_--Speriamo,_ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. _Ma, dia retta
 23871	a me. Ci rifletta_.
 23872	
 23873	By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram
 23874	unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.
 23875	
 23876	--_Ci rifletterÃ²,_ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.
 23877	
 23878	--_Ma, sul serio, eh?_ Almidano Artifoni said.
 23879	
 23880	His heavy hand took Stephen's firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously
 23881	an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.
 23882	
 23883	_--Eccolo,_ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. _Venga a trovarmi
 23884	e ci pensi. Addio, caro._
 23885	
 23886	--_Arrivederla, maestro,_ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand
 23887	was freed. _E grazie._
 23888	
 23889	--_Di che?_ Almidano Artifoni said. _Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!_
 23890	
 23891	Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal,
 23892	trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted,
 23893	signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
 23894	implements of music through Trinity gates.
 23895	
 23896	* * * * *
 23897	
 23898	Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_
 23899	far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her
 23900	typewriter.
 23901	
 23902	Too much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion?
 23903	Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.
 23904	
 23905	The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them:
 23906	six.
 23907	
 23908	Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:
 23909	
 23910	--16 June 1904.
 23911	
 23912	Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny's corner and the slab
 23913	where Wolfe Tone's statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L.
 23914	Y.'S and plodded back as they had come.
 23915	
 23916	Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming
 23917	soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and
 23918	capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She's not nicelooking,
 23919	is she? The way she's holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that
 23920	fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a
 23921	concertina skirt like Susy Nagle's. They kick out grand. Shannon and
 23922	all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he
 23923	won't keep me here till seven.
 23924	
 23925	The telephone rang rudely by her ear.
 23926	
 23927	--Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five. Only
 23928	those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go
 23929	after six if you're not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and
 23930	six. I'll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.
 23931	
 23932	She scribbled three figures on an envelope.
 23933	
 23934	--Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from SPORT was in looking for you. Mr
 23935	Lenehan, yes. He said he'll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes, sir.
 23936	I'll ring them up after five.
 23937	
 23938	* * * * *
 23939	
 23940	Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.
 23941	
 23942	--Who's that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?
 23943	
 23944	--Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.
 23945	
 23946	--Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his
 23947	pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.
 23948	
 23949	The vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself in a long
 23950	soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and
 23951	mouldy air closed round them.
 23952	
 23953	--How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.
 23954	
 23955	--Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic
 23956	council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed
 23957	himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.
 23958	O'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.
 23959	The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and
 23960	the original jews' temple was here too before they built their synagogue
 23961	over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?
 23962	
 23963	--No, Ned.
 23964	
 23965	--He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory
 23966	serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.
 23967	
 23968	--That's right, Ned Lambert said. That's quite right, sir.
 23969	
 23970	--If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to
 23971	allow me perhaps...
 23972	
 23973	--Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I'll
 23974	get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here
 23975	or from here.
 23976	
 23977	In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled
 23978	seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.
 23979	
 23980	From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.
 23981	
 23982	--I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won't trespass
 23983	on your valuable time...
 23984	
 23985	--You're welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next
 23986	week, say. Can you see?
 23987	
 23988	--Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.
 23989	
 23990	--Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.
 23991	
 23992	He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among
 23993	the pillars. With J. J. O'Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary's abbey
 23994	where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal,
 23995	O'Connor, Wexford.
 23996	
 23997	He stood to read the card in his hand.
 23998	
 23999	--The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint
 24000	Michael's, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He's writing a book about the
 24001	Fitzgeralds he told me. He's well up in history, faith.
 24002	
 24003	The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging
 24004	twig.
 24005	
 24006	--I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O'Molloy said.
 24007	
 24008	Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.
 24009	
 24010	--God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare
 24011	after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? _I'm bloody
 24012	sorry I did it,_ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop
 24013	was inside._ He mightn't like it, though. What? God, I'll tell him
 24014	anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they
 24015	were all of them, the Geraldines.
 24016	
 24017	The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He
 24018	slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:
 24019	
 24020	--Woa, sonny!
 24021	
 24022	He turned to J. J. O'Molloy and asked:
 24023	
 24024	--Well, Jack. What is it? What's the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.
 24025	
 24026	With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an
 24027	instant, sneezed loudly.
 24028	
 24029	--Chow! he said. Blast you!
 24030	
 24031	--The dust from those sacks, J. J. O'Molloy said politely.
 24032	
 24033	--No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast
 24034	your soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of
 24035	draught...
 24036	
 24037	He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...
 24038	
 24039	--I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call
 24040	him... Chow!... Mother of Moses!
 24041	
 24042	* * * * *
 24043	
 24044	Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his
 24045	claret waistcoat.
 24046	
 24047	--See? he said. Say it's turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.
 24048	
 24049	He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled
 24050	a while, ceased, ogling them: six.
 24051	
 24052	Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the
 24053	consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying
 24054	the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the
 24055	admiralty division of king's bench to the court of appeal an elderly
 24056	female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of
 24057	great amplitude.
 24058	
 24059	--See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.
 24060	The impact. Leverage, see?
 24061	
 24062	He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.
 24063	
 24064	--Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late
 24065	can see what turn is on and what turns are over.
 24066	
 24067	--See? Tom Rochford said.
 24068	
 24069	He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop:
 24070	four. Turn Now On.
 24071	
 24072	--I'll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good
 24073	turn deserves another.
 24074	
 24075	--Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I'm Boylan with impatience.
 24076	
 24077	--Goodnight, M'Coy said abruptly. When you two begin
 24078	
 24079	Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.
 24080	
 24081	--But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.
 24082	
 24083	--Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.
 24084	
 24085	He followed M'Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.
 24086	
 24087	--He's a hero, he said simply.
 24088	
 24089	--I know, M'Coy said. The drain, you mean.
 24090	
 24091	--Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.
 24092	
 24093	They passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming
 24094	soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.
 24095	
 24096	Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall
 24097	Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like
 24098	a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half
 24099	choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest and
 24100	all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round
 24101	the poor devil and the two were hauled up.
 24102	
 24103	--The act of a hero, he said.
 24104	
 24105	At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past
 24106	them for Jervis street.
 24107	
 24108	--This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam's
 24109	to see Sceptre's starting price. What's the time by your gold watch and
 24110	chain?
 24111	
 24112	M'Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses' sombre office, then at O'Neill's
 24113	clock.
 24114	
 24115	--After three, he said. Who's riding her?
 24116	
 24117	--O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.
 24118	
 24119	While he waited in Temple bar M'Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle
 24120	pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy
 24121	get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.
 24122	
 24123	The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal
 24124	cavalcade.
 24125	
 24126	--Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons
 24127	in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn't an
 24128	earthly. Through here.
 24129	
 24130	They went up the steps and under Merchants' arch. A darkbacked figure
 24131	scanned books on the hawker's cart.
 24132	
 24133	--There he is, Lenehan said.
 24134	
 24135	--Wonder what he's buying, M'Coy said, glancing behind.
 24136	
 24137	--_Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye,_ Lenehan said.
 24138	
 24139	--He's dead nuts on sales, M'Coy said. I was with him one day and he
 24140	bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were
 24141	fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and
 24142	comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.
 24143	
 24144	Lenehan laughed.
 24145	
 24146	--I'll tell you a damn good one about comets' tails, he said. Come over
 24147	in the sun.
 24148	
 24149	They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the
 24150	riverwall.
 24151	
 24152	Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's,
 24153	carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.
 24154	
 24155	--There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said
 24156	eagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord
 24157	mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan
 24158	Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d'Arcy sang and Benjamin
 24159	Dollard...
 24160	
 24161	--I know, M'Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.
 24162	
 24163	--Did she? Lenehan said.
 24164	
 24165	A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number 7
 24166	Eccles street.
 24167	
 24168	He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.
 24169	
 24170	--But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the
 24171	catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were
 24172	there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to
 24173	which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came
 24174	solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...
 24175	
 24176	--I know, M'Coy said. The year the missus was there...
 24177	
 24178	Lenehan linked his arm warmly.
 24179	
 24180	--But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after
 24181	all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the
 24182	morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's
 24183	night on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one
 24184	side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing
 24185	glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_. She was well primed
 24186	with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every jolt the
 24187	bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's delights! She
 24188	has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.
 24189	
 24190	He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:
 24191	
 24192	--I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.
 24193	Know what I mean?
 24194	
 24195	His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in
 24196	delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.
 24197	
 24198	--The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She's a gamey
 24199	mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets
 24200	in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and
 24201	Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was
 24202	lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last
 24203	she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. _And what star is that,
 24204	Poldy?_ says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. _That one, is it?_
 24205	says Chris Callinan, _sure that's only what you might call a pinprick._
 24206	By God, he wasn't far wide of the mark.
 24207	
 24208	Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.
 24209	
 24210	--I'm weak, he gasped.
 24211	
 24212	M'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan
 24213	walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead
 24214	rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy.
 24215	
 24216	--He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He's not one
 24217	of your common or garden... you know... There's a touch of the artist
 24218	about old Bloom.
 24219	
 24220	* * * * *
 24221	
 24222	Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria
 24223	Monk,_ then of Aristotle's _Masterpiece._ Crooked botched print. Plates:
 24224	infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered
 24225	cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All
 24226	butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute
 24227	somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.
 24228	
 24229	He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_
 24230	by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.
 24231	
 24232	--That I had, he said, pushing it by.
 24233	
 24234	The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.
 24235	
 24236	--Them are two good ones, he said.
 24237	
 24238	Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.
 24239	He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his
 24240	unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.
 24241	
 24242	On O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay
 24243	apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.
 24244	
 24245	Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. _Fair Tyrants_ by James
 24246	Lovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.
 24247	
 24248	He opened it. Thought so.
 24249	
 24250	A woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.
 24251	
 24252	No: she wouldn't like that much. Got her it once.
 24253	
 24254	He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_. More in her line. Let us see.
 24255	
 24256	He read where his finger opened.
 24257	
 24258	_--All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on
 24259	wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For raoul!_
 24260	
 24261	Yes. This. Here. Try.
 24262	
 24263	--_Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands
 24264	felt for the opulent curves inside her deshabillÃ©._
 24265	
 24266	Yes. Take this. The end.
 24267	
 24268	--_You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.
 24269	The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her
 24270	queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played
 24271	round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly._
 24272	
 24273	Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman._
 24274	
 24275	Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply
 24276	amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched
 24277	themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (_for Him! For Raoul!_).
 24278	Armpits' oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint!_).
 24279	Feel! Press! Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions!
 24280	
 24281	Young! Young!
 24282	
 24283	An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of
 24284	chancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in
 24285	the lord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the
 24286	admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the
 24287	Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal
 24288	reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident
 24289	and Guarantee Corporation.
 24290	
 24291	Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy
 24292	curtains. The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven
 24293	reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the
 24294	floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it,
 24295	and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.
 24296	
 24297	Mr Bloom beheld it.
 24298	
 24299	Mastering his troubled breath, he said:
 24300	
 24301	--I'll take this one.
 24302	
 24303	The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.
 24304	
 24305	--_Sweets of Sin,_ he said, tapping on it. That's a good one.
 24306	
 24307	* * * * *
 24308	
 24309	The lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell
 24310	twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.
 24311	
 24312	Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the
 24313	bell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely
 24314	curtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any
 24315	advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.
 24316	
 24317	The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:
 24318	
 24319	--Barang!
 24320	
 24321	Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.
 24322	J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched
 24323	necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.
 24324	
 24325	Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's row. He
 24326	halted near his daughter.
 24327	
 24328	--It's time for you, she said.
 24329	
 24330	--Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.
 24331	Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon
 24332	shoulder? Melancholy God!
 24333	
 24334	Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and
 24335	held them back.
 24336	
 24337	--Stand up straight, girl, he said. You'll get curvature of the spine.
 24338	Do you know what you look like?
 24339	
 24340	He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders
 24341	and dropping his underjaw.
 24342	
 24343	--Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.
 24344	
 24345	Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.
 24346	
 24347	--Did you get any money? Dilly asked.
 24348	
 24349	--Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin
 24350	would lend me fourpence.
 24351	
 24352	--You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.
 24353	
 24354	--How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.
 24355	
 24356	Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along
 24357	James's street.
 24358	
 24359	--I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?
 24360	
 24361	--I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns
 24362	taught you to be so saucy? Here.
 24363	
 24364	He handed her a shilling.
 24365	
 24366	--See if you can do anything with that, he said.
 24367	
 24368	--I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.
 24369	
 24370	--Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You're like the rest of
 24371	them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother
 24372	died. But wait awhile. You'll all get a short shrift and a long day from
 24373	me. Low blackguardism! I'm going to get rid of you. Wouldn't care if I
 24374	was stretched out stiff. He's dead. The man upstairs is dead.
 24375	
 24376	He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.
 24377	
 24378	--Well, what is it? he said, stopping.
 24379	
 24380	The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.
 24381	
 24382	--Barang!
 24383	
 24384	--Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.
 24385	
 24386	The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but
 24387	feebly:
 24388	
 24389	--Bang!
 24390	
 24391	Mr Dedalus stared at him.
 24392	
 24393	--Watch him, he said. It's instructive. I wonder will he allow us to
 24394	talk.
 24395	
 24396	--You got more than that, father, Dilly said.
 24397	
 24398	--I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I'll leave
 24399	you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there's all I have. I got
 24400	two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the
 24401	funeral.
 24402	
 24403	He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.
 24404	
 24405	--Can't you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.
 24406	
 24407	Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.
 24408	
 24409	--I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell
 24410	street. I'll try this one now.
 24411	
 24412	--You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning.
 24413	
 24414	--Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk
 24415	for yourself and a bun or a something. I'll be home shortly.
 24416	
 24417	He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.
 24418	
 24419	The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of
 24420	Parkgate.
 24421	
 24422	--I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.
 24423	
 24424	The lacquey banged loudly.
 24425	
 24426	Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing
 24427	mincing mouth gently:
 24428	
 24429	--The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn't do
 24430	anything! O, sure they wouldn't really! Is it little sister Monica!
 24431	
 24432	* * * * *
 24433	
 24434	From the sundial towards James's gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the
 24435	order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James's street,
 24436	past Shackleton's offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr
 24437	Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other
 24438	establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive.
 24439	Lovely weather we're having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those
 24440	farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your best
 24441	gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that
 24442	General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And
 24443	heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal
 24444	thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most
 24445	scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the
 24446	firehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever
 24447	allowed a boat like that... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins.
 24448	You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look
 24449	at that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were
 24450	bad here.
 24451	
 24452	I smiled at him. _America,_ I said quietly, just like that. _What is
 24453	it? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn't that true?_
 24454	That's a fact.
 24455	
 24456	Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there's money going there's
 24457	always someone to pick it up.
 24458	
 24459	Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy
 24460	appearance. Bowls them over.
 24461	
 24462	--Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?
 24463	
 24464	--Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.
 24465	
 24466	Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter
 24467	Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson
 24468	street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built
 24469	under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street
 24470	club toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian
 24471	bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he
 24472	remembered me.
 24473	
 24474	Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.
 24475	Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom
 24476	again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying
 24477	has it.
 24478	
 24479	North wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains,
 24480	sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the
 24481	ferrywash, Elijah is coming.
 24482	
 24483	Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course.
 24484	Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy
 24485	body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned
 24486	Lambert's brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn
 24487	it. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash
 24488	like that. Damn like him.
 24489	
 24490	Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good
 24491	drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his
 24492	fat strut.
 24493	
 24494	Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope.
 24495	Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife
 24496	drove by in her noddy.
 24497	
 24498	Bad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too.
 24499	Fourbottle men.
 24500	
 24501	Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michan's? Or no, there was a midnight
 24502	burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the
 24503	wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn
 24504	down here. Make a detour.
 24505	
 24506	Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by
 24507	the corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. Outside the Dublin
 24508	Distillers Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood,
 24509	the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary
 24510	bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.
 24511	
 24512	Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John
 24513	Henry Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for the
 24514	office of Messrs Collis and Ward.
 24515	
 24516	Mr Kernan approached Island street.
 24517	
 24518	Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those
 24519	reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all
 24520	now in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly's. No
 24521	cardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table
 24522	by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major
 24523	Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.
 24524	
 24525	Damn good gin that was.
 24526	
 24527	Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that
 24528	sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were
 24529	on the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that
 24530	is: Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad
 24531	touchingly. Masterly rendition.
 24532	
 24533	_At the siege of Ross did my father fall._
 24534	
 24535	A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping,
 24536	leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.
 24537	
 24538	Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.
 24539	
 24540	His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a
 24541	pity!
 24542	
 24543	* * * * *
 24544	
 24545	Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary's fingers
 24546	prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust
 24547	darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept
 24548	on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies,
 24549	leprous and winedark stones.
 24550	
 24551	Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights
 24552	shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of
 24553	their brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest
 24554	them.
 24555	
 24556	She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman,
 24557	rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed
 24558	silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her
 24559	hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.
 24560	
 24561	Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it
 24562	and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. Grandfather ape gloating
 24563	on a stolen hoard.
 24564	
 24565	And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words
 24566	of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat
 24567	standing from everlasting to everlasting.
 24568	
 24569	Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through
 24570	Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella,
 24571	one with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled.
 24572	
 24573	The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the
 24574	powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always
 24575	without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I
 24576	between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.
 24577	Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me
 24578	you who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A
 24579	look around.
 24580	
 24581	Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say
 24582	right, sir. A Monday morning, 'twas so, indeed.
 24583	
 24584	Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against
 24585	his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan
 24586	boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood
 24587	round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed
 24588	gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes'
 24589	hearts.
 24590	
 24591	He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.
 24592	
 24593	--Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.
 24594	
 24595	Tattered pages. _The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the CurÃ© of
 24596	Ars. Pocket Guide to Killarney._
 24597	
 24598	I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. _Stephano Dedalo,
 24599	alumno optimo, palmam ferenti._
 24600	
 24601	Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet
 24602	of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.
 24603	
 24604	Binding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses.
 24605	Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read.
 24606	Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for
 24607	white wine vinegar. How to win a woman's love. For me this. Say the
 24608	following talisman three times with hands folded:
 24609	
 24610	--_Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen._
 24611	
 24612	Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter
 24613	Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot's
 24614	charms, as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your
 24615	wool.
 24616	
 24617	--What are you doing here, Stephen?
 24618	
 24619	Dilly's high shoulders and shabby dress.
 24620	
 24621	Shut the book quick. Don't let see.
 24622	
 24623	--What are you doing? Stephen said.
 24624	
 24625	A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It
 24626	glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her
 24627	of Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a
 24628	pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly's token. _Nebrakada femininum._
 24629	
 24630	--What have you there? Stephen asked.
 24631	
 24632	--I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing
 24633	nervously. Is it any good?
 24634	
 24635	My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring.
 24636	Shadow of my mind.
 24637	
 24638	He took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal's French primer.
 24639	
 24640	--What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?
 24641	
 24642	She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.
 24643	
 24644	Show no surprise. Quite natural.
 24645	
 24646	--Here, Stephen said. It's all right. Mind Maggy doesn't pawn it on you.
 24647	I suppose all my books are gone.
 24648	
 24649	--Some, Dilly said. We had to.
 24650	
 24651	She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will
 24652	drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me,
 24653	my heart, my soul. Salt green death.
 24654	
 24655	We.
 24656	
 24657	Agenbite of inwit. Inwit's agenbite.
 24658	
 24659	Misery! Misery!
 24660	
 24661	* * * * *
 24662	
 24663	--Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?
 24664	
 24665	--Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.
 24666	
 24667	They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. Father Cowley
 24668	brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.
 24669	
 24670	--What's the best news? Mr Dedalus said.
 24671	
 24672	--Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I'm barricaded up, Simon, with
 24673	two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.
 24674	
 24675	--Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?
 24676	
 24677	--O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.
 24678	
 24679	--With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.
 24680	
 24681	--The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I'm just
 24682	waiting for Ben Dollard. He's going to say a word to long John to get
 24683	him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.
 24684	
 24685	He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in
 24686	his neck.
 24687	
 24688	--I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He's always
 24689	doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!
 24690	
 24691	He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.
 24692	
 24693	--There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.
 24694	
 24695	Ben Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops
 24696	crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards
 24697	them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.
 24698	
 24699	As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:
 24700	
 24701	--Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.
 24702	
 24703	--Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.
 24704	
 24705	Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben
 24706	Dollard's figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered
 24707	sneeringly:
 24708	
 24709	--That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day?
 24710	
 24711	--Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I
 24712	threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.
 24713	
 24714	He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes
 24715	from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:
 24716	
 24717	--They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.
 24718	
 24719	--Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to
 24720	God he's not paid yet.
 24721	
 24722	--And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.
 24723	
 24724	Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,
 24725	glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.
 24726	
 24727	Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth a
 24728	deep note.
 24729	
 24730	--Aw! he said.
 24731	
 24732	--That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.
 24733	
 24734	--What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?
 24735	
 24736	He turned to both.
 24737	
 24738	--That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.
 24739	
 24740	The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint
 24741	Mary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by
 24742	Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of
 24743	hurdles.
 24744	
 24745	Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,
 24746	his joyful fingers in the air.
 24747	
 24748	--Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. I want to
 24749	show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He's a cross between
 24750	Lobengula and Lynchehaun. He's well worth seeing, mind you. Come along.
 24751	I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost
 24752	me a fall if I don't... Wait awhile... We're on the right lay, Bob,
 24753	believe you me.
 24754	
 24755	--For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.
 24756	
 24757	Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button
 24758	of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
 24759	heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.
 24760	
 24761	--What few days? he boomed. Hasn't your landlord distrained for rent?
 24762	
 24763	--He has, Father Cowley said.
 24764	
 24765	--Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben
 24766	Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the
 24767	particulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?
 24768	
 24769	--That's right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He's a
 24770	minister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?
 24771	
 24772	--You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that
 24773	writ where Jacko put the nuts.
 24774	
 24775	He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.
 24776	
 24777	--Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his
 24778	glasses on his coatfront, following them.
 24779	
 24780	* * * * *
 24781	
 24782	--The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they
 24783	passed out of the Castleyard gate.
 24784	
 24785	The policeman touched his forehead.
 24786	
 24787	--God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.
 24788	
 24789	He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on
 24790	towards Lord Edward street.
 24791	
 24792	Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared above
 24793	the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.
 24794	
 24795	--Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father
 24796	Conmee and laid the whole case before him.
 24797	
 24798	--You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.
 24799	
 24800	--Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.
 24801	
 24802	John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them
 24803	quickly down Cork hill.
 24804	
 24805	On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed
 24806	Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.
 24807	
 24808	The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.
 24809	
 24810	--Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_
 24811	office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.
 24812	
 24813	--Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the
 24814	five shillings too.
 24815	
 24816	--Without a second word either, Mr Power said.
 24817	
 24818	--Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.
 24819	
 24820	John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.
 24821	
 24822	--I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.
 24823	
 24824	They went down Parliament street.
 24825	
 24826	--There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's.
 24827	
 24828	--Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.
 24829	
 24830	Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's
 24831	brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.
 24832	
 24833	John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took
 24834	the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked
 24835	uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches.
 24836	
 24837	--The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John
 24838	Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.
 24839	
 24840	They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. The
 24841	empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham,
 24842	speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not
 24843	glance.
 24844	
 24845	--And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as
 24846	life.
 24847	
 24848	The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.
 24849	
 24850	--Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and
 24851	greeted.
 24852	
 24853	Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay
 24854	decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all
 24855	their faces.
 24856	
 24857	--Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he
 24858	said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.
 24859	
 24860	Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,
 24861	about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted
 24862	to know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the
 24863	macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order,
 24864	no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little
 24865	Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him. Damned Irish language,
 24866	language of our forefathers.
 24867	
 24868	Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.
 24869	
 24870	Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the
 24871	assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his
 24872	peace.
 24873	
 24874	--What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.
 24875	
 24876	Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.
 24877	
 24878	--O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness' sake
 24879	till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!
 24880	
 24881	Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning's flank and
 24882	passed in and up the stairs.
 24883	
 24884	--Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don't think
 24885	you knew him or perhaps you did, though.
 24886	
 24887	With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.
 24888	
 24889	--Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long
 24890	John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.
 24891	
 24892	--Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham
 24893	said.
 24894	
 24895	Long John Fanning could not remember him.
 24896	
 24897	Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.
 24898	
 24899	--What's that? Martin Cunningham said.
 24900	
 24901	All turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the
 24902	cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street,
 24903	harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past
 24904	before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders,
 24905	leaping leaders, rode outriders.
 24906	
 24907	--What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the
 24908	staircase.
 24909	
 24910	--The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse
 24911	Nolan answered from the stairfoot.
 24912	
 24913	* * * * *
 24914	
 24915	As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his
 24916	Panama to Haines:
 24917	
 24918	--Parnell's brother. There in the corner.
 24919	
 24920	They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose
 24921	beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.
 24922	
 24923	--Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.
 24924	
 24925	--Yes, Mulligan said. That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.
 24926	
 24927	John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw
 24928	went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under
 24929	its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell
 24930	once more upon a working corner.
 24931	
 24932	--I'll take a _mÃ©lange,_ Haines said to the waitress.
 24933	
 24934	--Two _mÃ©langes,_ Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and
 24935	butter and some cakes as well.
 24936	
 24937	When she had gone he said, laughing:
 24938	
 24939	--We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed
 24940	Dedalus on _Hamlet._
 24941	
 24942	Haines opened his newbought book.
 24943	
 24944	--I'm sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all
 24945	minds that have lost their balance.
 24946	
 24947	The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:
 24948	
 24949	--_England expects_...
 24950	
 24951	Buck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.
 24952	
 24953	--You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.
 24954	Wandering Aengus I call him.
 24955	
 24956	--I am sure he has an _idÃ©e fixe,_ Haines said, pinching his chin
 24957	thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it
 24958	would be likely to be. Such persons always have.
 24959	
 24960	Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.
 24961	
 24962	--They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never
 24963	capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white
 24964	death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet.
 24965	The joy of creation...
 24966	
 24967	--Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him
 24968	this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw.
 24969	It's rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an
 24970	interesting point out of that.
 24971	
 24972	Buck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to
 24973	unload her tray.
 24974	
 24975	--He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid
 24976	the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,
 24977	of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does
 24978	he write anything for your movement?
 24979	
 24980	He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.
 24981	Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its
 24982	smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.
 24983	
 24984	--Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write
 24985	something in ten years.
 24986	
 24987	--Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.
 24988	Still, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all.
 24989	
 24990	He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.
 24991	
 24992	--This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don't
 24993	want to be imposed on.
 24994	
 24995	Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of
 24996	ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping
 24997	street past Benson's ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_
 24998	from Bridgwater with bricks.
 24999	
 25000	* * * * *
 25001	
 25002	Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard.
 25003	Behind him Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with
 25004	stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's
 25005	house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him a
 25006	blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.
 25007	
 25008	Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as
 25009	Mr Lewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along
 25010	Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.
 25011	
 25012	At the corner of Wilde's house he halted, frowned at Elijah's name
 25013	announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of
 25014	duke's lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth
 25015	bared he muttered:
 25016	
 25017	--_Coactus volui._
 25018	
 25019	He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.
 25020	
 25021	As he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his dustcoat
 25022	brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,
 25023	having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly
 25024	face after the striding form.
 25025	
 25026	--God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You're blinder
 25027	nor I am, you bitch's bastard!
 25028	
 25029	* * * * *
 25030	
 25031	Opposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the
 25032	pound and a half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he had been
 25033	sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming
 25034	dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs
 25035	MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping
 25036	sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney's.
 25037	And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole
 25038	blooming time and sighing.
 25039	
 25040	After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner,
 25041	stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their
 25042	pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning
 25043	Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will
 25044	meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty
 25045	sovereigns. Gob, that'd be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh,
 25046	that's the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar
 25047	entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master
 25048	Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That's me in mourning. When
 25049	is it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He
 25050	turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry,
 25051	his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the
 25052	image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One
 25053	of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old
 25054	fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.
 25055	
 25056	Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going
 25057	for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would
 25058	knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for
 25059	science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of
 25060	him, dodging and all.
 25061	
 25062	In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth and
 25063	a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was
 25064	telling him and grinning all the time.
 25065	
 25066	No Sandymount tram.
 25067	
 25068	Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to
 25069	his other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The
 25070	blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming
 25071	end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow
 25072	either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice
 25073	I'm in mourning? Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight.
 25074	Then they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's
 25075	name.
 25076	
 25077	His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a
 25078	fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they
 25079	were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were
 25080	bringing it downstairs.
 25081	
 25082	Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling
 25083	the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and
 25084	heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing
 25085	on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney's for
 25086	to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him
 25087	again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be
 25088	a good son to ma. I couldn't hear the other things he said but I saw
 25089	his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was
 25090	Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he's in purgatory now because he went to
 25091	confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.
 25092	
 25093	* * * * *
 25094	
 25095	William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by
 25096	lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal
 25097	lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de
 25098	Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.
 25099	
 25100	The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by
 25101	obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern
 25102	quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the
 25103	metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted
 25104	him vainly from afar Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley's
 25105	viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B.
 25106	L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the
 25107	pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with
 25108	his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough
 25109	more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot
 25110	through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the
 25111	porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,
 25112	Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the
 25113	doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the
 25114	Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed
 25115	her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously
 25116	on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall
 25117	under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of
 25118	liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze,
 25119	Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond
 25120	quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the
 25121	subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low.
 25122	His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's
 25123	corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived,
 25124	mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich
 25125	advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking leave of each
 25126	other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene's office and
 25127	Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby's
 25128	cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style
 25129	it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see what Her
 25130	Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow furniture van
 25131	had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant.
 25132	Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms
 25133	John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord
 25134	lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable
 25135	William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all
 25136	times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked
 25137	models, the gentleman Henry, _dernier cri_ James. Over against Dame gate
 25138	Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom
 25139	Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs
 25140	quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to
 25141	her. A charming _soubrette,_ great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and
 25142	lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl
 25143	of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon
 25144	the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck
 25145	Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage
 25146	over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the
 25147	chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's
 25148	street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first
 25149	French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the
 25150	glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings,
 25151	stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not
 25152	looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King
 25153	Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband
 25154	back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the
 25155	tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast
 25156	and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C.,
 25157	agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded
 25158	white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind
 25159	him, E.L.Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite
 25160	Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c,
 25161	gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved.
 25162	By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes
 25163	and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of _My girl's a Yorkshire
 25164	girl._
 25165	
 25166	Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high
 25167	action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a
 25168	suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute
 25169	but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and
 25170	the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His
 25171	Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of
 25172	music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland
 25173	laddies blared and drumthumped after the _cortÃ¨ge_:
 25174	
 25175	     _But though she's a factory lass
 25176	     And wears no fancy clothes.
 25177	     Baraabum.
 25178	     Yet I've a sort of a
 25179	     Yorkshire relish for
 25180	     My little Yorkshire rose.
 25181	     Baraabum._
 25182	
 25183	Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H.
 25184	Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson,
 25185	C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn's
 25186	hotel Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a
 25187	fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons
 25188	in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster
 25189	street by Trinity's postern a loyal king's man, Hornblower, touched
 25190	his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master
 25191	Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent
 25192	with the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased
 25193	by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to
 25194	inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer's hospital,
 25195	drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind
 25196	stripling opposite Broadbent's. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a
 25197	brown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across
 25198	the viceroy's path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding,
 25199	Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to
 25200	Pembroke township. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted
 25201	themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view
 25202	with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain.
 25203	On Northumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged
 25204	punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small
 25205	schoolboys at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired
 25206	by the late queen when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the
 25207	prince consort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano Artifoni's sturdy
 25208	trousers swallowed by a closing door.
 25209	
 25210	
 25211	
 25212	Bronze by gold heard the hoofirons, steelyringing Imperthnthn thnthnthn.
 25213	
 25214	Chips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips.
 25215	
 25216	Horrid! And gold flushed more.
 25217	
 25218	A husky fifenote blew.
 25219	
 25220	Blew. Blue bloom is on the.
 25221	
 25222	Goldpinnacled hair.
 25223	
 25224	A jumping rose on satiny breast of satin, rose of Castile.
 25225	
 25226	Trilling, trilling: Idolores.
 25227	
 25228	Peep! Who's in the... peepofgold?
 25229	
 25230	Tink cried to bronze in pity.
 25231	
 25232	And a call, pure, long and throbbing. Longindying call.
 25233	
 25234	Decoy. Soft word. But look: the bright stars fade. Notes chirruping
 25235	answer.
 25236	
 25237	O rose! Castile. The morn is breaking.
 25238	
 25239	Jingle jingle jaunted jingling.
 25240	
 25241	Coin rang. Clock clacked.
 25242	
 25243	Avowal. _Sonnez._ I could. Rebound of garter. Not leave thee. Smack. _La
 25244	cloche!_ Thigh smack. Avowal. Warm. Sweetheart, goodbye!
 25245	
 25246	Jingle. Bloo.
 25247	
 25248	Boomed crashing chords. When love absorbs. War! War! The tympanum.
 25249	
 25250	A sail! A veil awave upon the waves.
 25251	
 25252	Lost. Throstle fluted. All is lost now.
 25253	
 25254	Horn. Hawhorn.
 25255	
 25256	When first he saw. Alas!
 25257	
 25258	Full tup. Full throb.
 25259	
 25260	Warbling. Ah, lure! Alluring.
 25261	
 25262	Martha! Come!
 25263	
 25264	Clapclap. Clipclap. Clappyclap.
 25265	
 25266	Goodgod henev erheard inall.
 25267	
 25268	Deaf bald Pat brought pad knife took up.
 25269	
 25270	A moonlit nightcall: far, far.
 25271	
 25272	I feel so sad. P. S. So lonely blooming.
 25273	
 25274	Listen!
 25275	
 25276	The spiked and winding cold seahorn. Have you the? Each, and for other,
 25277	plash and silent roar.
 25278	
 25279	Pearls: when she. Liszt's rhapsodies. Hissss.
 25280	
 25281	You don't?
 25282	
 25283	Did not: no, no: believe: Lidlyd. With a cock with a carra.
 25284	
 25285	Black. Deepsounding. Do, Ben, do.
 25286	
 25287	Wait while you wait. Hee hee. Wait while you hee.
 25288	
 25289	But wait!
 25290	
 25291	Low in dark middle earth. Embedded ore.
 25292	
 25293	Naminedamine. Preacher is he:
 25294	
 25295	All gone. All fallen.
 25296	
 25297	Tiny, her tremulous fernfoils of maidenhair.
 25298	
 25299	Amen! He gnashed in fury.
 25300	
 25301	Fro. To, fro. A baton cool protruding.
 25302	
 25303	Bronzelydia by Minagold.

 25305	By bronze, by gold, in oceangreen of shadow. Bloom. Old Bloom.
 25306	
 25307	One rapped, one tapped, with a carra, with a cock.
 25308	
 25309	Pray for him! Pray, good people!
 25310	
 25311	His gouty fingers nakkering.
 25312	
 25313	Big Benaben. Big Benben.
 25314	
 25315	Last rose Castile of summer left bloom I feel so sad alone.
 25316	
 25317	Pwee! Little wind piped wee.
 25318	
 25319	True men. Lid Ker Cow De and Doll. Ay, ay. Like you men. Will lift your
 25320	tschink with tschunk.
 25321	
 25322	Fff! Oo!
 25323	
 25324	Where bronze from anear? Where gold from afar? Where hoofs?
 25325	
 25326	Rrrpr. Kraa. Kraandl.
 25327	
 25328	Then not till then. My eppripfftaph. Be pfrwritt.
 25329	
 25330	Done.
 25331	
 25332	Begin!
 25333	
 25334	Bronze by gold, miss Douce's head by miss Kennedy's head, over the
 25335	crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing
 25336	steel.
 25337	
 25338	--Is that her? asked miss Kennedy.
 25339	
 25340	Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de Nil._
 25341	
 25342	--Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.
 25343	
 25344	When all agog miss Douce said eagerly:
 25345	
 25346	--Look at the fellow in the tall silk.
 25347	
 25348	--Who? Where? gold asked more eagerly.
 25349	
 25350	--In the second carriage, miss Douce's wet lips said, laughing in the
 25351	sun.
 25352	
 25353	He's looking. Mind till I see.
 25354	
 25355	She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against
 25356	the pane in a halo of hurried breath.
 25357	
 25358	Her wet lips tittered:
 25359	
 25360	--He's killed looking back.
 25361	
 25362	She laughed:
 25363	
 25364	--O wept! Aren't men frightful idiots?
 25365	
 25366	With sadness.
 25367	
 25368	Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair
 25369	behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a
 25370	hair.
 25371	
 25372	Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.
 25373	
 25374	--It's them has the fine times, sadly then she said.
 25375	
 25376	A man.
 25377	
 25378	Bloowho went by by Moulang's pipes bearing in his breast the sweets
 25379	of sin, by Wine's antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by
 25380	Carroll's dusky battered plate, for Raoul.
 25381	
 25382	The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them
 25383	unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And
 25384	
 25385	--There's your teas, he said.
 25386	
 25387	Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned
 25388	lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.
 25389	
 25390	--What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.
 25391	
 25392	--Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.
 25393	
 25394	--Your _beau,_ is it?
 25395	
 25396	A haughty bronze replied:
 25397	
 25398	--I'll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your
 25399	impertinent insolence.
 25400	
 25401	--Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as
 25402	she threatened as he had come.
 25403	
 25404	Bloom.
 25405	
 25406	On her flower frowning miss Douce said:
 25407	
 25408	--Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn't conduct himself
 25409	I'll wring his ear for him a yard long.
 25410	
 25411	Ladylike in exquisite contrast.
 25412	
 25413	--Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.
 25414	
 25415	She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered
 25416	under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned,
 25417	waiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black
 25418	satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and
 25419	seven.
 25420	
 25421	Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs
 25422	ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.
 25423	
 25424	--Am I awfully sunburnt?
 25425	
 25426	Miss bronze unbloused her neck.
 25427	
 25428	--No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with
 25429	the cherry laurel water?
 25430	
 25431	Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror
 25432	gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their
 25433	midst a shell.
 25434	
 25435	--And leave it to my hands, she said.
 25436	
 25437	--Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.
 25438	
 25439	Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce
 25440	
 25441	--Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that
 25442	old fogey in Boyd's for something for my skin.
 25443	
 25444	Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:
 25445	
 25446	--O, don't remind me of him for mercy' sake!
 25447	
 25448	--But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.
 25449	
 25450	Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears
 25451	with little fingers.
 25452	
 25453	--No, don't, she cried.
 25454	
 25455	--I won't listen, she cried.
 25456	
 25457	But Bloom?
 25458	
 25459	Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone:
 25460	
 25461	--For your what? says he.
 25462	
 25463	Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed
 25464	again:
 25465	
 25466	--Don't let me think of him or I'll expire. The hideous old wretch! That
 25467	night in the Antient Concert Rooms.
 25468	
 25469	She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.
 25470	
 25471	--Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters,
 25472	ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!
 25473	
 25474	Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. Miss Douce
 25475	huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a
 25476	snout in quest.
 25477	
 25478	--O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?
 25479	
 25480	Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:
 25481	
 25482	--And your other eye!
 25483	
 25484	Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. Why do I always think
 25485	Figather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Lore's huguenot name.
 25486	By Bassi's blessed virgins Bloom's dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white
 25487	under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I
 25488	could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus' son.
 25489	He might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of
 25490	fellows in: her white.
 25491	
 25492	By went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.
 25493	
 25494	Of sin.
 25495	
 25496	In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy
 25497	your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let
 25498	freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other,
 25499	high piercing notes.
 25500	
 25501	Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.
 25502	
 25503	Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and
 25504	gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her
 25505	nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping,
 25506	her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed,
 25507	spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter,
 25508	coughing with choking, crying:
 25509	
 25510	--O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.
 25511	With his bit of beard!
 25512	
 25513	Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,
 25514	delight, joy, indignation.
 25515	
 25516	--Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.
 25517	
 25518	Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each
 25519	each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze,
 25520	shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I
 25521	knows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and
 25522	pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!),
 25523	panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.
 25524	
 25525	Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.
 25526	
 25527	--O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I
 25528	wished
 25529	
 25530	I hadn't laughed so much. I feel all wet.
 25531	
 25532	--O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!
 25533	
 25534	And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.
 25535	
 25536	By Cantwell's offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi's virgins, bright of
 25537	their oils. Nannetti's father hawked those things about, wheedling at
 25538	doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want.
 25539	Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On.
 25540	Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five
 25541	guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets
 25542	of sin.
 25543	
 25544	Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.
 25545	
 25546	Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his
 25547	rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.
 25548	
 25549	--O, welcome back, miss Douce.
 25550	
 25551	He held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?
 25552	
 25553	--Tiptop.
 25554	
 25555	He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.
 25556	
 25557	--Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the
 25558	strand all day.
 25559	
 25560	Bronze whiteness.
 25561	
 25562	--That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed
 25563	her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.
 25564	
 25565	Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.
 25566	
 25567	--O go away! she said. You're very simple, I don't think.
 25568	
 25569	He was.
 25570	
 25571	--Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they
 25572	christened me simple Simon.
 25573	
 25574	--You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did the
 25575	doctor order today?
 25576	
 25577	--Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I'll trouble
 25578	you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.
 25579	
 25580	Jingle.
 25581	
 25582	--With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.
 25583	
 25584	With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane's
 25585	she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from
 25586	her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought
 25587	pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky
 25588	fifenotes.
 25589	
 25590	--By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must
 25591	be a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at
 25592	last, they say. Yes. Yes.
 25593	
 25594	Yes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid's, into the
 25595	bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.
 25596	
 25597	None nought said nothing. Yes.
 25598	
 25599	Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:
 25600	
 25601	--_O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!_
 25602	
 25603	--Was Mr Lidwell in today?
 25604	
 25605	In came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex
 25606	bridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write.
 25607	Buy paper. Daly's. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on
 25608	the rye.
 25609	
 25610	--He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.
 25611	
 25612	Lenehan came forward.
 25613	
 25614	--Was Mr Boylan looking for me?
 25615	
 25616	He asked. She answered:
 25617	
 25618	--Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?
 25619	
 25620	She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her
 25621	gaze upon a page:
 25622	
 25623	--No. He was not.
 25624	
 25625	Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the
 25626	sandwichbell wound his round body round.
 25627	
 25628	--Peep! Who's in the corner?
 25629	
 25630	No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her
 25631	stops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.
 25632	
 25633	Jingle jaunty jingle.
 25634	
 25635	Girlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice
 25636	while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:
 25637	
 25638	--Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your
 25639	bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?
 25640	
 25641	He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.
 25642	
 25643	He sighed aside:
 25644	
 25645	--Ah me! O my!
 25646	
 25647	He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.
 25648	
 25649	--Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.
 25650	
 25651	--Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.
 25652	
 25653	Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?
 25654	
 25655	--Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.
 25656	
 25657	Dry.
 25658	
 25659	Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.
 25660	
 25661	--I see, he said. I didn't recognise him for the moment. I hear he is
 25662	keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?
 25663	
 25664	He had.
 25665	
 25666	--I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In
 25667	Mooney's _en ville_ and in Mooney's _sur mer._ He had received the rhino
 25668	for the labour of his muse.
 25669	
 25670	He smiled at bronze's teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:
 25671	
 25672	--The _Ã©lite_ of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh
 25673	
 25674	MacHugh, Dublin's most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy
 25675	of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the
 25676	O'Madden Burke.
 25677	
 25678	After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and
 25679	
 25680	--That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.
 25681	
 25682	He see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his
 25683	glass.
 25684	
 25685	He looked towards the saloon door.
 25686	
 25687	--I see you have moved the piano.
 25688	
 25689	--The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking
 25690	concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.
 25691	
 25692	--Is that a fact?
 25693	
 25694	--Didn't he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too,
 25695	poor fellow. Not twenty I'm sure he was.
 25696	
 25697	--Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.
 25698	
 25699	He drank and strayed away.
 25700	
 25701	--So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.
 25702	
 25703	God's curse on bitch's bastard.
 25704	
 25705	Tink to her pity cried a diner's bell. To the door of the bar and
 25706	diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.
 25707	Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.
 25708	
 25709	With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for
 25710	jinglejaunty blazes boy.
 25711	
 25712	Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique
 25713	triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her
 25714	hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt
 25715	advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.
 25716	
 25717	Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in
 25718	Wisdom Hely's wise Bloom in Daly's Henry Flower bought. Are you not
 25719	happy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means
 25720	something, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is.
 25721	Respectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed
 25722	on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke
 25723	mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man.
 25724	For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a
 25725	jaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.
 25726	
 25727	Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.
 25728	Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.
 25729	
 25730	--Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.
 25731	
 25732	--Aha... I was forgetting... Excuse...
 25733	
 25734	--And four.
 25735	
 25736	At four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go.
 25737	Ternoon. Think you're the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all.
 25738	
 25739	For men.
 25740	
 25741	In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.
 25742	
 25743	From the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the
 25744	tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now
 25745	poised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly
 25746	and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.
 25747	
 25748	Pat paid for diner's popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and
 25749	popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss
 25750	
 25751	Douce.
 25752	
 25753	--_The bright stars fade_...
 25754	
 25755	A voiceless song sang from within, singing:
 25756	
 25757	--... _the morn is breaking._
 25758	
 25759	A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive
 25760	hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording,
 25761	called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's
 25762	leavetaking, life's, love's morn.
 25763	
 25764	--_The dewdrops pearl_...
 25765	
 25766	Lenehan's lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.
 25767	
 25768	--But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.
 25769	
 25770	Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.
 25771	
 25772	She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn,
 25773	dreamily rose.
 25774	
 25775	--Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.
 25776	
 25777	She answered, slighting:
 25778	
 25779	--Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies.
 25780	
 25781	Like lady, ladylike.
 25782	
 25783	Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.
 25784	Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and knew and
 25785	hailed him:
 25786	
 25787	--See the conquering hero comes.
 25788	
 25789	Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered
 25790	hero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat walked
 25791	towards Richie Goulding's legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.
 25792	
 25793	--_And I from thee_...
 25794	
 25795	--I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.
 25796	
 25797	He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled
 25798	on him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer
 25799	hair, a bosom and a rose.
 25800	
 25801	Smart Boylan bespoke potions.
 25802	
 25803	--What's your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a
 25804	sloegin for me. Wire in yet?
 25805	
 25806	Not yet. At four she. Who said four?
 25807	
 25808	Cowley's red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff's office.
 25809	
 25810	Avoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.
 25811	
 25812	Wait.
 25813	
 25814	Hello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What,
 25815	Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there.
 25816	See, not be seen. I think I'll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom
 25817	followed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.
 25818	
 25819	Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her
 25820	bust, that all but burst, so high.
 25821	
 25822	--O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!
 25823	
 25824	But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.
 25825	
 25826	--Why don't you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.
 25827	
 25828	Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his
 25829	lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and
 25830	syrupped with her voice:
 25831	
 25832	--Fine goods in small parcels.
 25833	
 25834	That is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.
 25835	
 25836	--Here's fortune, Blazes said.
 25837	
 25838	He pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.
 25839	
 25840	--Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...
 25841	
 25842	--Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.
 25843	
 25844	--Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.
 25845	
 25846	--I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you
 25847	know. Fancy of a friend of mine.
 25848	
 25849	Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce's
 25850	lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.
 25851	
 25852	Idolores. The eastern seas.
 25853	
 25854	Clock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave),
 25855	bearing away teatray. Clock clacked.
 25856	
 25857	Miss Douce took Boylan's coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It
 25858	clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till
 25859	and hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For
 25860	me.
 25861	
 25862	--What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?
 25863	
 25864	O'clock.
 25865	
 25866	Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes
 25867	Boylan's elbowsleeve.
 25868	
 25869	--Let's hear the time, he said.
 25870	
 25871	The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.
 25872	Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near
 25873	the door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come:
 25874	whet appetite. I couldn't do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.
 25875	
 25876	Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure's skyblue bow and eyes.
 25877	
 25878	--Go on, pressed Lenehan. There's no-one. He never heard.
 25879	
 25880	--... _to Flora's lips did hie._
 25881	
 25882	High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.
 25883	
 25884	Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought
 25885	
 25886	Blazes Boylan's flower and eyes.
 25887	
 25888	--Please, please.
 25889	
 25890	He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.
 25891	
 25892	--_I could not leave thee_...
 25893	
 25894	--Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.
 25895	
 25896	--No, now, urged Lenehan. _Sonnezlacloche!_ O do! There's no-one.
 25897	
 25898	She looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling
 25899	faces watched her bend.
 25900	
 25901	Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord,
 25902	and lost and found it, faltering.
 25903	
 25904	--Go on! Do! _Sonnez!_
 25905	
 25906	Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted
 25907	them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.
 25908	
 25909	_--Sonnez!_
 25910	
 25911	Smack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter
 25912	smackwarm against her smackable a woman's warmhosed thigh.
 25913	
 25914	--_La Cloche!_ cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust
 25915	there.
 25916	
 25917	She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren't men?), but, lightward
 25918	gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.
 25919	
 25920	--You're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.
 25921	
 25922	Boylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his
 25923	chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound
 25924	eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by
 25925	mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering,
 25926	a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.
 25927	
 25928	Yes, bronze from anearby.
 25929	
 25930	--... _Sweetheart, goodbye!_
 25931	
 25932	--I'm off, said Boylan with impatience.
 25933	
 25934	He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.
 25935	
 25936	--Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.
 25937	
 25938	Tom Rochford...
 25939	
 25940	--Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.
 25941	
 25942	Lenehan gulped to go.
 25943	
 25944	--Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I'm coming.
 25945	
 25946	He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the
 25947	threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.
 25948	
 25949	--How do you do, Mr Dollard?
 25950	
 25951	--Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard's vague bass answered, turning an
 25952	instant from Father Cowley's woe. He won't give you any trouble, Bob.
 25953	Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We'll put a barleystraw in
 25954	that Judas Iscariot's ear this time.
 25955	
 25956	Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.
 25957	
 25958	--Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a
 25959	ditty. We heard the piano.
 25960	
 25961	Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie.
 25962	And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How
 25963	warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me
 25964	see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.
 25965	
 25966	--What's that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.
 25967	
 25968	--Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.
 25969	
 25970	He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the:
 25971	hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His
 25972	gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.
 25973	
 25974	Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted
 25975	Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.
 25976	
 25977	Jingle a tinkle jaunted.
 25978	
 25979	Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He's off. Light sob of breath Bloom
 25980	sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He's gone. Jingle.
 25981	Hear.
 25982	
 25983	--Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.
 25984	
 25985	Miss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten
 25986	by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light),
 25987	she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive
 25988	(why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where
 25989	bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite
 25990	nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, _eau de
 25991	Nil._
 25992	
 25993	--Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded
 25994	them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the
 25995	Collard grand.
 25996	
 25997	There was.
 25998	
 25999	--A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn't stop him.
 26000	He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.
 26001	
 26002	--God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the
 26003	punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.
 26004	
 26005	They laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding
 26006	garment.
 26007	
 26008	--Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where's
 26009	my pipe, by the way?
 26010	
 26011	He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two
 26012	diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.
 26013	
 26014	--I saved the situation, Ben, I think.
 26015	
 26016	--You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too.
 26017	That was a brilliant idea, Bob.
 26018	
 26019	Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa.
 26020	Tight trou. Brilliant ide.
 26021	
 26022	--I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in
 26023	the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and
 26024	who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you
 26025	remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the
 26026	chap in Keogh's gave us the number. Remember? Ben remembered, his broad
 26027	visage wondering.
 26028	
 26029	--By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.
 26030	
 26031	Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.
 26032	
 26033	--Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He
 26034	wouldn't take any money either. What? Any God's quantity of cocked hats
 26035	and boleros and trunkhose. What?
 26036	
 26037	--Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of
 26038	all descriptions.
 26039	
 26040	Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.
 26041	
 26042	Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.
 26043	
 26044	Mrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice
 26045	name he.
 26046	
 26047	--What's this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion...
 26048	
 26049	--Tweedy.
 26050	
 26051	--Yes. Is she alive?
 26052	
 26053	--And kicking.
 26054	
 26055	--She was a daughter of...
 26056	
 26057	--Daughter of the regiment.
 26058	
 26059	--Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.
 26060	
 26061	Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after
 26062	
 26063	--Irish? I don't know, faith. Is she, Simon?
 26064	
 26065	Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.
 26066	
 26067	--Buccinator muscle is... What?... Bit rusty... O, she is... My
 26068	Irish Molly, O.
 26069	
 26070	He puffed a pungent plumy blast.
 26071	
 26072	--From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.
 26073	
 26074	They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze
 26075	by maraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace,
 26076	Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.
 26077	
 26078	Pat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before he
 26079	ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods' roes while
 26080	Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney,
 26081	bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.
 26082	
 26083	Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.
 26084	
 26085	By Bachelor's walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in
 26086	heat, mare's glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres:
 26087	sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you the?
 26088	Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.
 26089	
 26090	Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding
 26091	chords:
 26092	
 26093	--_When love absorbs my ardent soul_...
 26094	
 26095	Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.
 26096	
 26097	--War! War! cried Father Cowley. You're the warrior.
 26098	
 26099	--So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or
 26100	money.
 26101	
 26102	He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.
 26103	
 26104	--Sure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said
 26105	through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.
 26106	
 26107	In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.
 26108	
 26109	--Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben.
 26110	_Amoroso ma non troppo._ Let me there.
 26111	
 26112	Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She
 26113	passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather.
 26114	They drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going?
 26115	And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn't say. But it would
 26116	be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about
 26117	her outspread _Independent,_ searching, the lord lieutenant, her
 26118	pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble,
 26119	first gentleman said. O, not in the least. Way he looked that. Lord
 26120	lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.
 26121	
 26122	     --............ _my ardent soul_
 26123	     _I care not foror the morrow._
 26124	
 26125	In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is.
 26126	Ben Dollard's famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit
 26127	for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers.
 26128	Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed,
 26129	screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above,
 26130	I'm drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many!
 26131	Well, of course that's what gives him the base barreltone. For instance
 26132	eunuchs. Wonder who's playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical.
 26133	Knows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.
 26134	
 26135	Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George
 26136	Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a
 26137	lady's) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the old
 26138	dingdong again.
 26139	
 26140	--Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.
 26141	
 26142	George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.
 26143	
 26144	Bloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the
 26145	Burton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables,
 26146	flowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do.
 26147	Best value in Dub.
 26148	
 26149	Piano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together,
 26150	mutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the
 26151	bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore.
 26152	Night we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between
 26153	the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor's
 26154	legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.
 26155	
 26156	Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.
 26157	
 26158	Only the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a
 26159	lovely. Gravy's rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that
 26160	once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their
 26161	harps. I. He. Old. Young.
 26162	
 26163	--Ah, I couldn't, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.
 26164	
 26165	Strongly.
 26166	
 26167	--Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.
 26168	
 26169	--_M'appari,_ Simon, Father Cowley said.
 26170	
 26171	Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long
 26172	arms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he
 26173	sang to a dusty seascape there: _A Last Farewell._ A headland, a ship, a
 26174	sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the
 26175	wind upon the headland, wind around her.
 26176	
 26177	Cowley sang:
 26178	
 26179	     _--M'appari tutt'amor:
 26180	     Il mio sguardo l'incontr..._
 26181	
 26182	She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to
 26183	wind, love, speeding sail, return.
 26184	
 26185	--Go on, Simon.
 26186	
 26187	--Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...
 26188	
 26189	Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting,
 26190	touched the obedient keys.
 26191	
 26192	--No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.
 26193	
 26194	The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.
 26195	
 26196	Up stage strode Father Cowley.
 26197	
 26198	--Here, Simon, I'll accompany you, he said. Get up.
 26199	
 26200	By Graham Lemon's pineapple rock, by Elvery's elephant jingly jogged.
 26201	Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom
 26202	and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.
 26203	
 26204	Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: _Sonnambula._ He
 26205	heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M'Guckin! Yes. In his way.
 26206	Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like.
 26207	Never forget it. Never.
 26208	
 26209	Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.
 26210	Backache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the
 26211	piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile.
 26212	Sings too: _Down among the dead men._ Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to
 26213	the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him.
 26214	Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry
 26215	water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign
 26216	in dribs and drabs. And when he's wanted not a farthing. Screwed
 26217	refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.
 26218	
 26219	Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In the
 26220	gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.
 26221	
 26222	Speech paused on Richie's lips.
 26223	
 26224	Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all.
 26225	
 26226	Believes his own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good
 26227	memory.
 26228	
 26229	--Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.
 26230	
 26231	--_All is lost now_.
 26232	
 26233	Richie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee
 26234	murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth
 26235	he's proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two
 26236	notes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my
 26237	motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all.
 26238	Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he
 26239	whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.
 26240	
 26241	Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase.
 26242	Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence
 26243	in the moon. Brave. Don't know their danger. Still hold her back. Call
 26244	name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That's
 26245	why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.
 26246	
 26247	--A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.
 26248	
 26249	Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.
 26250	
 26251	He knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise
 26252	child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?
 26253	
 26254	Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking
 26255	Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his
 26256	eye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I
 26257	did sir. Wouldn't trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.
 26258	
 26259	Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably.
 26260	Stopped again.
 26261	
 26262	Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.
 26263	
 26264	--With it, Simon.
 26265	
 26266	--It, Simon.
 26267	
 26268	--Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind
 26269	solicitations.
 26270	
 26271	--It, Simon.
 26272	
 26273	--I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall
 26274	endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.
 26275	
 26276	By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a
 26277	lady's grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous _eau de Nil_ Mina
 26278	to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.
 26279	
 26280	The harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant,
 26281	drew a voice away.
 26282	
 26283	--_When first I saw that form endearing_...
 26284	
 26285	Richie turned.
 26286	
 26287	--Si Dedalus' voice, he said.
 26288	
 26289	Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow
 26290	endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to
 26291	Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the
 26292	bar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited, waiting
 26293	to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.
 26294	
 26295	--_Sorrow from me seemed to depart._
 26296	
 26297	Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves
 26298	in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem
 26299	dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their
 26300	each his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each
 26301	seemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw,
 26302	lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn't expect
 26303	it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.
 26304	
 26305	Love that is singing: love's old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the
 26306	elastic band of his packet. Love's old sweet _sonnez la_ gold. Bloom
 26307	wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound
 26308	it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.
 26309	
 26310	--_Full of hope and all delighted_...
 26311	
 26312	Tenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his
 26313	feet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He
 26314	can't sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him.
 26315	What perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last
 26316	look at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How
 26317	do you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits,
 26318	in her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.
 26319	
 26320	Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.
 26321	
 26322	--_But alas, 'twas idle dreaming_...
 26323	
 26324	Glorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly
 26325	man! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out
 26326	his wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he
 26327	doesn't break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing
 26328	too. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind
 26329	soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.
 26330	
 26331	Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That's the chat.
 26332	Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.
 26333	
 26334	Words? Music? No: it's what's behind.
 26335	
 26336	Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.
 26337	
 26338	Bloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music
 26339	out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her
 26340	tapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy
 26341	the feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o'er sluices pouring gushes. Flood,
 26342	gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.
 26343	
 26344	--... _ray of hope is_...
 26345	
 26346	Beaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse
 26347	unsqueaked a ray of hopk.
 26348	
 26349	_Martha_ it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel's song.
 26350	Lovely name you have. Can't write. Accept my little pres. Play on her
 26351	heartstrings pursestrings too. She's a. I called you naughty boy. Still
 26352	the name: Martha. How strange! Today.
 26353	
 26354	The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to
 26355	Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to
 26356	wait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part,
 26357	how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom's heart.
 26358	
 26359	Wish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in
 26360	Drago's always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still
 26361	hear it better here than in the bar though farther.
 26362	
 26363	--_Each graceful look_...
 26364	
 26365	First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon's in Terenure. Yellow,
 26366	black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her.
 26367	Fate.
 26368	
 26369	Round and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down she
 26370	sat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.
 26371	
 26372	--_Charmed my eye_...
 26373	
 26374	Singing. _Waiting_ she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of perfume
 26375	of what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat
 26376	warbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy
 26377	eyes. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in
 26378	shadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.
 26379	
 26380	--_Martha! Ah, Martha!_
 26381	
 26382	Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant
 26383	to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In
 26384	cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For
 26385	only her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where.
 26386	Somewhere.
 26387	
 26388	     --_Co-ome, thou lost one!
 26389	     Co-ome, thou dear one!_
 26390	
 26391	Alone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chestnote, return!
 26392	
 26393	_--Come!_
 26394	
 26395	It soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver orb
 26396	it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don't spin it out too
 26397	long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent,
 26398	aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the
 26399	etherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all
 26400	soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness...
 26401	
 26402	--_To me!_
 26403	
 26404	Siopold!
 26405	
 26406	Consumed.
 26407	
 26408	Come. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come. To me, to him, to her,
 26409	you too, me, us.
 26410	
 26411	--Bravo! Clapclap. Good man, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore! Clapclipclap
 26412	clap. Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore, enclap, said,
 26413	cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George Lidwell, Pat, Mina
 26414	Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent with tank
 26415	and bronze miss Douce and gold MJiss Mina.
 26416	
 26417	Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before.
 26418	Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson,
 26419	reverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted, as said before just now.
 26420	Atrot, in heat, heatseated. _Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la._
 26421	Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too
 26422	slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.
 26423	
 26424	An afterclang of Cowley's chords closed, died on the air made richer.
 26425	
 26426	And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank,
 26427	Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two
 26428	more tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving,
 26429	coral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.
 26430	
 26431	--Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you'd
 26432	sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.
 26433	
 26434	Lionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy
 26435	served. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired,
 26436	admired. But Bloom sang dumb.
 26437	
 26438	Admiring.
 26439	
 26440	Richie, admiring, descanted on that man's glorious voice. He remembered
 26441	one night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang _'Twas rank and
 26442	fame_: in Ned Lambert's 'twas. Good God he never heard in all his life a
 26443	note like that he never did _then false one we had better part_ so clear
 26444	so God he never heard _since love lives not_ a clinking voice lives not
 26445	ask Lambert he can tell you too.
 26446	
 26447	Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the
 26448	night, Si in Ned Lambert's, Dedalus house, sang _'Twas rank and fame._
 26449	
 26450	He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom, of
 26451	the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing 'TWAS RANK AND FAME in
 26452	his, Ned Lambert's, house.
 26453	
 26454	Brothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the
 26455	lute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more.
 26456	The night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful,
 26457	more than all others.
 26458	
 26459	That voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It's in the silence after you
 26460	feel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.
 26461	
 26462	Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the
 26463	slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While
 26464	Goulding talked of Barraclough's voice production, while Tom Kernan,
 26465	harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening
 26466	Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While
 26467	big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he
 26468	smoked, who smoked.
 26469	
 26470	Thou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his
 26471	string. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them on.
 26472	Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head. Outtohelloutofthat.
 26473	Human life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat's tail wriggling! Five bob I gave.
 26474	_Corpus paradisum._ Corncrake croaker: belly like a poisoned pup. Gone.
 26475	They sing. Forgotten. I too; And one day she with. Leave her: get
 26476	tired. Suffer then. Snivel. Big spanishy eyes goggling at nothing. Her
 26477	wavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevyhair un comb:'d.
 26478	
 26479	Yet too much happy bores. He stretched more, more. Are you not happy in
 26480	your? Twang. It snapped.
 26481	
 26482	Jingle into Dorset street.
 26483	
 26484	Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.
 26485	
 26486	--Don't make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.
 26487	
 26488	George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.
 26489	
 26490	First gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so. And
 26491	second tankard told her so. That that was so.
 26492	
 26493	Miss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not
 26494	believe: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first:
 26495	gent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell:
 26496	the tank.
 26497	
 26498	Better write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.
 26499	
 26500	Bald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He went. A
 26501	pad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.
 26502	
 26503	--Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is.
 26504	Few lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who
 26505	is this wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper,
 26506	envelope: unconcerned. It's so characteristic.
 26507	
 26508	--Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.
 26509	
 26510	--It is, Bloom said.
 26511	
 26512	Numbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two
 26513	divided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus two
 26514	plus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling. Always
 26515	find out this equal to that. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. He doesn't
 26516	see my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics. And you
 26517	think you're listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it like:
 26518	Martha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall quite
 26519	flat. It's on account of the sounds it is.
 26520	
 26521	Instance he's playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like, till you
 26522	hear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then hear
 26523	chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks, over barrels,
 26524	through wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune. Question of mood
 26525	you're in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up and down, girls
 26526	learning. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to invent dummy pianos
 26527	for that. _Blumenlied_ I bought for her. The name. Playing it slow,
 26528	a girl, night I came home, the girl. Door of the stables near Cecilia
 26529	street. Milly no taste. Queer because we both, I mean.
 26530	
 26531	Bald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Pat set with ink pen quite
 26532	flat pad. Pat took plate dish knife fork. Pat went.
 26533	
 26534	It was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. He heard them as a
 26535	boy in Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles.
 26536	Queenstown harbour full of Italian ships. Walking, you know, Ben, in the
 26537	moonlight with those earthquake hats. Blending their voices. God, such
 26538	music, Ben. Heard as a boy. Cross Ringabella haven mooncarole.
 26539	
 26540	Sour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a
 26541	moonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying.
 26542	
 26543	Down the edge of his _Freeman_ baton ranged Bloom's, your other eye,
 26544	scanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick.
 26545	Heigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking...
 26546	
 26547	Hope he's not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his _Freeman._
 26548	Can't see now. Remember write Greek ees. Bloom dipped, Bloo mur: dear
 26549	sir. Dear Henry wrote: dear Mady. Got your lett and flow. Hell did I
 26550	put? Some pock or oth. It is utterl imposs. Underline _imposs._ To write
 26551	today.
 26552	
 26553	Bore this. Bored Bloom tambourined gently with I am just reflecting
 26554	fingers on flat pad Pat brought.
 26555	
 26556	On. Know what I mean. No, change that ee. Accep my poor litt pres
 26557	enclos. Ask her no answ. Hold on. Five Dig. Two about here. Penny the
 26558	gulls. Elijah is com. Seven Davy Byrne's. Is eight about. Say half a
 26559	crown. My poor little pres: p. o. two and six. Write me a long. Do you
 26560	despise? Jingle, have you the? So excited. Why do you call me naught?
 26561	You naughty too? O, Mairy lost the string of her. Bye for today. Yes,
 26562	yes, will tell you. Want to. To keep it up. Call me that other. Other
 26563	world she wrote. My patience are exhaust. To keep it up. You must
 26564	believe. Believe. The tank. It. Is. True.
 26565	
 26566	Folly am I writing? Husbands don't. That's marriage does, their wives.
 26567	Because I'm away from. Suppose. But how? She must. Keep young. If she
 26568	found out. Card in my high grade ha. No, not tell all. Useless pain. If
 26569	they don't see. Woman. Sauce for the gander.
 26570	
 26571	A hackney car, number three hundred and twentyfour, driver Barton James
 26572	of number one Harmony avenue, Donnybrook, on which sat a fare, a young
 26573	gentleman, stylishly dressed in an indigoblue serge suit made by George
 26574	Robert Mesias, tailor and cutter, of number five Eden quay, and wearing
 26575	a straw hat very dressy, bought of John Plasto of number one Great
 26576	Brunswick street, hatter. Eh? This is the jingle that joggled and
 26577	jingled. By Dlugacz' porkshop bright tubes of Agendath trotted a
 26578	gallantbuttocked mare.
 26579	
 26580	--Answering an ad? keen Richie's eyes asked Bloom.
 26581	
 26582	--Yes, Mr Bloom said. Town traveller. Nothing doing, I expect.
 26583	
 26584	Bloom mur: best references. But Henry wrote: it will excite me. You
 26585	know how. In haste. Henry. Greek ee. Better add postscript. What is he
 26586	playing now? Improvising. Intermezzo. P. S. The rum tum tum. How will
 26587	you pun? You punish me? Crooked skirt swinging, whack by. Tell me I want
 26588	to. Know. O. Course if I didn't I wouldn't ask. La la la ree. Trails off
 26589	there sad in minor. Why minor sad? Sign H. They like sad tail at end. P.
 26590	P. S. La la la ree. I feel so sad today. La ree. So lonely. Dee.
 26591	
 26592	He blotted quick on pad of Pat. Envel. Address. Just copy out of paper.
 26593	Murmured: Messrs Callan, Coleman and Co, limited. Henry wrote:
 26594	
 26595	Miss Martha Clifford c/o P. O. Dolphin's Barn Lane Dublin
 26596	
 26597	Blot over the other so he can't read. There. Right. Idea prize titbit.
 26598	Something detective read off blottingpad. Payment at the rate of guinea
 26599	per col. Matcham often thinks the laughing witch. Poor Mrs Purefoy. U.
 26600	P: up.
 26601	
 26602	Too poetical that about the sad. Music did that. Music hath charms.
 26603	Shakespeare said. Quotations every day in the year. To be or not to be.
 26604	Wisdom while you wait.
 26605	
 26606	In Gerard's rosery of Fetter lane he walks, greyedauburn. One life is
 26607	all. One body. Do. But do.
 26608	
 26609	Done anyhow. Postal order, stamp. Postoffice lower down. Walk now.
 26610	Enough. Barney Kiernan's I promised to meet them. Dislike that job.
 26611	
 26612	House of mourning. Walk. Pat! Doesn't hear. Deaf beetle he is.
 26613	
 26614	Car near there now. Talk. Talk. Pat! Doesn't. Settling those napkins.
 26615	Lot of ground he must cover in the day. Paint face behind on him then
 26616	he'd be two. Wish they'd sing more. Keep my mind off.
 26617	
 26618	Bald Pat who is bothered mitred the napkins. Pat is a waiter hard of his
 26619	hearing. Pat is a waiter who waits while you wait. Hee hee hee hee. He
 26620	waits while you wait. Hee hee. A waiter is he. Hee hee hee hee. He waits
 26621	while you wait. While you wait if you wait he will wait while you wait.
 26622	Hee hee hee hee. Hoh. Wait while you wait.
 26623	
 26624	Douce now. Douce Lydia. Bronze and rose.
 26625	
 26626	She had a gorgeous, simply gorgeous, time. And look at the lovely shell
 26627	she brought.
 26628	
 26629	To the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding
 26630	seahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor, might hear.
 26631	
 26632	--Listen! she bade him.
 26633	
 26634	Under Tom Kernan's ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow.
 26635	Authentic fact. How Walter Bapty lost his voice. Well, sir, the husband
 26636	took him by the throat. _Scoundrel,_ said he, _You'll sing no more
 26637	lovesongs._ He did, faith, sir Tom. Bob Cowley wove. Tenors get wom.
 26638	Cowley lay back.
 26639	
 26640	Ah, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Hear! He heard.
 26641	
 26642	Wonderful. She held it to her own. And through the sifted light pale
 26643	gold in contrast glided. To hear.
 26644	
 26645	Tap.
 26646	
 26647	Bloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more
 26648	faintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for
 26649	other, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.
 26650	
 26651	Bronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.
 26652	
 26653	Her ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside.
 26654	Lovely seaside girls. Skin tanned raw. Should have put on coldcream
 26655	first make it brown. Buttered toast. O and that lotion mustn't forget.
 26656	Fever near her mouth. Your head it simply. Hair braided over: shell with
 26657	seaweed. Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? And Turks the
 26658	mouth, why? Her eyes over the sheet. Yashmak. Find the way in. A cave.
 26659	No admittance except on business.
 26660	
 26661	The sea they think they hear. Singing. A roar. The blood it is. Souse in
 26662	the ear sometimes. Well, it's a sea. Corpuscle islands.
 26663	
 26664	Wonderful really. So distinct. Again. George Lidwell held its murmur,
 26665	hearing: then laid it by, gently.
 26666	
 26667	--What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled.
 26668	
 26669	Charming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.
 26670	
 26671	Tap.
 26672	
 26673	By Larry O'Rourke's, by Larry, bold Larry O', Boylan swayed and Boylan
 26674	turned.
 26675	
 26676	From the forsaken shell miss Mina glided to her tankards waiting. No,
 26677	she was not so lonely archly miss Douce's head let Mr Lidwell know.
 26678	Walks in the moonlight by the sea. No, not alone. With whom? She nobly
 26679	answered: with a gentleman friend.
 26680	
 26681	Bob Cowley's twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord
 26682	has the prior. A little time. Long John. Big Ben. Lightly he played a
 26683	light bright tinkling measure for tripping ladies, arch and smiling,
 26684	and for their gallants, gentlemen friends. One: one, one, one, one, one:
 26685	two, one, three, four.
 26686	
 26687	Sea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattlemarket,
 26688	cocks, hens don't crow, snakes hissss. There's music everywhere.
 26689	Ruttledge's door: ee creaking. No, that's noise. Minuet of _Don
 26690	Giovanni_ he's playing now. Court dresses of all descriptions in castle
 26691	chambers dancing. Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating
 26692	dockleaves. Nice that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look
 26693	at us.
 26694	
 26695	That's joyful I can feel. Never have written it. Why? My joy is other
 26696	joy. But both are joys. Yes, joy it must be. Mere fact of music shows
 26697	you are. Often thought she was in the dumps till she began to lilt. Then
 26698	know.
 26699	
 26700	M'Coy valise. My wife and your wife. Squealing cat. Like tearing silk.
 26701	Tongue when she talks like the clapper of a bellows. They can't manage
 26702	men's intervals. Gap in their voices too. Fill me. I'm warm, dark, open.
 26703	Molly in _quis est homo_: Mercadante. My ear against the wall to hear.
 26704	Want a woman who can deliver the goods.
 26705	
 26706	Jog jig jogged stopped. Dandy tan shoe of dandy Boylan socks skyblue
 26707	clocks came light to earth.
 26708	
 26709	O, look we are so! Chamber music. Could make a kind of pun on that.
 26710	It is a kind of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is.
 26711	Tinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the
 26712	resonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to
 26713	the law of falling water. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt's, Hungarian,
 26714	gipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle.
 26715	Hissss. Now. Maybe now. Before.
 26716	
 26717	One rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de Kock
 26718	with a loud proud knocker with a cock carracarracarra cock. Cockcock.
 26719	
 26720	Tap.
 26721	
 26722	--_Qui sdegno,_ Ben, said Father Cowley.
 26723	
 26724	--No, Ben, Tom Kernan interfered. _The Croppy Boy._ Our native Doric.
 26725	
 26726	--Ay do, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. Good men and true.
 26727	
 26728	--Do, do, they begged in one.
 26729	
 26730	I'll go. Here, Pat, return. Come. He came, he came, he did not stay. To
 26731	me. How much?
 26732	
 26733	--What key? Six sharps?
 26734	
 26735	--F sharp major, Ben Dollard said.
 26736	
 26737	Bob Cowley's outstretched talons griped the black deepsounding chords.
 26738	
 26739	Must go prince Bloom told Richie prince. No, Richie said. Yes, must. Got
 26740	money somewhere. He's on for a razzle backache spree. Much? He seehears
 26741	lipspeech. One and nine. Penny for yourself. Here. Give him twopence
 26742	tip. Deaf, bothered. But perhaps he has wife and family waiting, waiting
 26743	Patty come home. Hee hee hee hee. Deaf wait while they wait.
 26744	
 26745	But wait. But hear. Chords dark. Lugugugubrious. Low. In a cave of the
 26746	dark middle earth. Embedded ore. Lumpmusic.
 26747	
 26748	The voice of dark age, of unlove, earth's fatigue made grave approach
 26749	and painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men
 26750	and true. The priest he sought. With him would he speak a word.
 26751	
 26752	Tap.
 26753	
 26754	Ben Dollard's voice. Base barreltone. Doing his level best to say it.
 26755	Croak of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh. Other comedown. Big
 26756	ships' chandler's business he did once. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships'
 26757	lanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in the Iveagh
 26758	home. Cubicle number so and so. Number one Bass did that for him.
 26759	
 26760	The priest's at home. A false priest's servant bade him welcome. Step
 26761	in. The holy father. With bows a traitor servant. Curlycues of chords.
 26762	
 26763	Ruin them. Wreck their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their days
 26764	in. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die.
 26765	
 26766	The voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered
 26767	a lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footsteps there, told them
 26768	the gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.
 26769	
 26770	Decent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he'll win in _Answers,_ poets'
 26771	picture puzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note. Bird sitting hatching
 26772	in a nest. Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was. See blank tee
 26773	what domestic animal? Tee dash ar most courageous mariner. Good voice he
 26774	has still. No eunuch yet with all his belongings.
 26775	
 26776	Listen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf
 26777	Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened. The chords harped slower.
 26778	
 26779	The voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous.
 26780	Ben's contrite beard confessed. _in nomine Domini,_ in God's name he
 26781	knelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: _mea culpa._
 26782	
 26783	Latin again. That holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion
 26784	corpus for those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey,
 26785	_corpusnomine._ Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape.
 26786	
 26787	Tap.
 26788	
 26789	They listened. Tankards and miss Kennedy. George Lidwell, eyelid well
 26790	expressive, fullbusted satin. Kernan. Si.
 26791	
 26792	The sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since Easter he had cursed
 26793	three times. You bitch's bast. And once at masstime he had gone to play.
 26794	Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother's rest he had
 26795	not prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.
 26796	
 26797	Bronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn't
 26798	half know I'm. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.
 26799	
 26800	Bronze gazed far sideways. Mirror there. Is that best side of her face?
 26801	They always know. Knock at the door. Last tip to titivate.
 26802	
 26803	Cockcarracarra.
 26804	
 26805	What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes.
 26806	Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked
 26807	that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too.
 26808	Custom his country perhaps. That's music too. Not as bad as it sounds.
 26809	Tootling. Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses helpless,
 26810	gashes in their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open crocodile
 26811	music hath jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin's name.
 26812	
 26813	She looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore lowcut, belongings on show.
 26814	Clove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question.
 26815	Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa's. Hypnotised,
 26816	listening. Eyes like that. She bent. Chap in dresscircle staring down
 26817	into her with his operaglass for all he was worth. Beauty of music you
 26818	must hear twice. Nature woman half a look. God made the country man the
 26819	tune. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy. O rocks!
 26820	
 26821	All gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his
 26822	brothers fell. To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last of
 26823	his name and race.
 26824	
 26825	I too. Last of my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No
 26826	son. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?
 26827	
 26828	He bore no hate.
 26829	
 26830	Hate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I am old. Big Ben his voice
 26831	unfolded. Great voice Richie Goulding said, a flush struggling in his
 26832	pale, to Bloom soon old. But when was young?
 26833	
 26834	Ireland comes now. My country above the king. She listens. Who fears to
 26835	speak of nineteen four? Time to be shoving. Looked enough.
 26836	
 26837	--_Bless me, father,_ Dollard the croppy cried. _Bless me and let me
 26838	go._
 26839	
 26840	Tap.
 26841	
 26842	Bloom looked, unblessed to go. Got up to kill: on eighteen bob a week.
 26843	Fellows shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. Those
 26844	girls, those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl's romance. Letters
 26845	read out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy's owny Mumpsypum.
 26846	Laughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. The lovely name you.
 26847	
 26848	Low sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest
 26849	rustling soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all by
 26850	heart. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.
 26851	
 26852	Tap. Tap.
 26853	
 26854	Thrilled she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.
 26855	
 26856	Blank face. Virgin should say: or fingered only. Write something on it:
 26857	page. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young.
 26858	Even admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white woman,
 26859	a flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes, all women. Goddess I
 26860	didn't see. They want it. Not too much polite. That's why he gets them.
 26861	Gold in your pocket, brass in your face. Say something. Make her hear.
 26862	With look to look. Songs without words. Molly, that hurdygurdy boy.
 26863	She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so like the Spanish.
 26864	Understand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of nature.
 26865	
 26866	Ventriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?
 26867	
 26868	Will? You? I. Want. You. To.
 26869	
 26870	With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch's
 26871	bastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour's your time to live,
 26872	your last.
 26873	
 26874	Tap. Tap.
 26875	
 26876	Thrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs that want
 26877	to, dying to, die. For all things dying, for all things born. Poor Mrs
 26878	Purefoy. Hope she's over. Because their wombs.
 26879	
 26880	A liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly,
 26881	hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder
 26882	river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom's wave (her heaving embon) red
 26883	rose rose slowly sank red rose. Heartbeats: her breath: breath that is
 26884	life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.
 26885	
 26886	But look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castile. The morn. Ha. Lidwell.
 26887	For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from here though.
 26888	Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.
 26889	
 26890	On the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand, lightly, plumply, leave
 26891	it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over
 26892	the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and
 26893	finger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid
 26894	so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding
 26895	through their sliding ring.
 26896	
 26897	With a cock with a carra.
 26898	
 26899	Tap. Tap. Tap.
 26900	
 26901	I hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors swing.
 26902	
 26903	The chords consented. Very sad thing. But had to be. Get out before the
 26904	end. Thanks, that was heavenly. Where's my hat. Pass by her. Can leave
 26905	that Freeman. Letter I have. Suppose she were the? No. Walk, walk,
 26906	walk. Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice Tisntdall Farrell.
 26907	Waaaaaaalk.
 26908	
 26909	Well, I must be. Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup. O'er ryehigh blue.
 26910	Ow. Bloom stood up. Soap feeling rather sticky behind. Must have
 26911	sweated: music. That lotion, remember. Well, so long. High grade. Card
 26912	inside. Yes.
 26913	
 26914	By deaf Pat in the doorway straining ear Bloom passed.
 26915	
 26916	At Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid.
 26917	Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to
 26918	dolorous prayer.
 26919	
 26920	By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties,
 26921	by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and
 26922	faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely
 26923	Bloom.
 26924	
 26925	Tap. Tap. Tap.
 26926	
 26927	Pray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard. You who hear in peace. Breathe
 26928	a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people. He was the croppy boy.
 26929	
 26930	Scaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway
 26931	heard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all
 26932	treading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus off for a swill to
 26933	wash it down. Glad I avoided.
 26934	
 26935	--Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus cried. By God, you're as good as ever you
 26936	were.
 26937	
 26938	--Better, said Tomgin Kernan. Most trenchant rendition of that ballad,
 26939	upon my soul and honour It is.
 26940	
 26941	--Lablache, said Father Cowley.
 26942	
 26943	Ben Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed
 26944	and all big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering
 26945	castagnettes in the air.
 26946	
 26947	Big Benaben Dollard. Big Benben. Big Benben.
 26948	
 26949	Rrr.
 26950	
 26951	And deepmoved all, Simon trumping compassion from foghorn nose, all
 26952	laughing they brought him forth, Ben Dollard, in right good cheer.
 26953	
 26954	--You're looking rubicund, George Lidwell said.
 26955	
 26956	Miss Douce composed her rose to wait.
 26957	
 26958	--Ben machree, said Mr Dedalus, clapping Ben's fat back shoulderblade.
 26959	Fit as a fiddle only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his
 26960	person.
 26961	
 26962	Rrrrrrrsss.
 26963	
 26964	--Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.
 26965	
 26966	Richie rift in the lute alone sat: Goulding, Collis, Ward. Uncertainly
 26967	he waited. Unpaid Pat too.
 26968	
 26969	Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.
 26970	
 26971	Miss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankard one.
 26972	
 26973	--Mr Dollard, they murmured low.
 26974	
 26975	--Dollard, murmured tankard.
 26976	
 26977	Tank one believed: miss Kenn when she: that doll he was: she doll: the
 26978	tank.
 26979	
 26980	He murmured that he knew the name. The name was familiar to him, that
 26981	is to say. That was to say he had heard the name of. Dollard, was it?
 26982	Dollard, yes.
 26983	
 26984	Yes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely,
 26985	murmured Mina. Mr Dollard. And _The last rose of summer_ was a lovely
 26986	song. Mina loved that song. Tankard loved the song that Mina.
 26987	
 26988	'Tis the last rose of summer dollard left bloom felt wind wound round
 26989	inside.
 26990	
 26991	Gassy thing that cider: binding too. Wait. Postoffice near Reuben J's
 26992	one and eightpence too. Get shut of it. Dodge round by Greek street.
 26993	Wish I hadn't promised to meet. Freer in air. Music. Gets on your
 26994	nerves. Beerpull. Her hand that rocks the cradle rules the. Ben Howth.
 26995	That rules the world.
 26996	
 26997	Far. Far. Far. Far.
 26998	
 26999	Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.
 27000	
 27001	Up the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with letter for Mady, with
 27002	sweets of sin with frillies for Raoul with met him pike hoses went Poldy
 27003	on.
 27004	
 27005	Tap blind walked tapping by the tap the curbstone tapping, tap by tap.
 27006	
 27007	Cowley, he stuns himself with it: kind of drunkenness. Better give way
 27008	only half way the way of a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All
 27009	ears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time. Dotty.
 27010	You daren't budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking shop.
 27011	Fiddlefaddle about notes.
 27012	
 27013	All a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant when it stops because you
 27014	never know exac. Organ in Gardiner street. Old Glynn fifty quid a year.
 27015	Queer up there in the cockloft, alone, with stops and locks and keys.
 27016	Seated all day at the organ. Maunder on for hours, talking to himself or
 27017	the other fellow blowing the bellows. Growl angry, then shriek cursing
 27018	(want to have wadding or something in his no don't she cried), then all
 27019	of a soft sudden wee little wee little pipy wind.
 27020	
 27021	Pwee! A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom's little wee.
 27022	
 27023	--Was he? Mr Dedalus said, returning with fetched pipe. I was with him
 27024	this morning at poor little Paddy Dignam's...
 27025	
 27026	--Ay, the Lord have mercy on him.
 27027	
 27028	--By the bye there's a tuningfork in there on the...
 27029	
 27030	Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.
 27031	
 27032	--The wife has a fine voice. Or had. What? Lidwell asked.
 27033	
 27034	--O, that must be the tuner, Lydia said to Simonlionel first I saw,
 27035	forgot it when he was here.
 27036	
 27037	Blind he was she told George Lidwell second I saw. And played so
 27038	exquisitely, treat to hear. Exquisite contrast: bronzelid, minagold.
 27039	
 27040	--Shout! Ben Dollard shouted, pouring. Sing out!
 27041	
 27042	--'lldo! cried Father Cowley.
 27043	
 27044	Rrrrrr.
 27045	
 27046	I feel I want...
 27047	
 27048	Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap
 27049	
 27050	--Very, Mr Dedalus said, staring hard at a headless sardine.
 27051	
 27052	Under the sandwichbell lay on a bier of bread one last, one lonely, last
 27053	sardine of summer. Bloom alone.
 27054	
 27055	--Very, he stared. The lower register, for choice.
 27056	
 27057	Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.
 27058	
 27059	Bloom went by Barry's. Wish I could. Wait. That wonderworker if I had.
 27060	Twentyfour solicitors in that one house. Counted them. Litigation. Love
 27061	one another. Piles of parchment. Messrs Pick and Pocket have power of
 27062	attorney. Goulding, Collis, Ward.
 27063	
 27064	But for example the chap that wallops the big drum. His vocation: Mickey
 27065	Rooney's band. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home after
 27066	pig's cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair. Rehearsing his band
 27067	part. Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the wife. Asses' skins. Welt them through
 27068	life, then wallop after death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to be what you call
 27069	yashmak or I mean kismet. Fate.
 27070	
 27071	Tap. Tap. A stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by
 27072	Daly's window where a mermaid hair all streaming (but he couldn't see)
 27073	blew whiffs of a mermaid (blind couldn't), mermaid, coolest whiff of
 27074	all.
 27075	
 27076	Instruments. A blade of grass, shell of her hands, then blow. Even
 27077	comb and tissuepaper you can knock a tune out of. Molly in her shift in
 27078	Lombard street west, hair down. I suppose each kind of trade made its
 27079	own, don't you see? Hunter with a horn. Haw. Have you the? _Cloche.
 27080	Sonnez la._ Shepherd his pipe. Pwee little wee. Policeman a whistle.
 27081	Locks and keys! Sweep! Four o'clock's all's well! Sleep! All is lost
 27082	now. Drum? Pompedy. Wait. I know. Towncrier, bumbailiff. Long John.
 27083	Waken the dead. Pom. Dignam. Poor little _nominedomine._ Pom. It is
 27084	music. I mean of course it's all pom pom pom very much what they call
 27085	_da capo._ Still you can hear. As we march, we march along, march along.
 27086	Pom.
 27087	
 27088	I must really. Fff. Now if I did that at a banquet. Just a question of
 27089	custom shah of Persia. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear. All the same
 27090	he must have been a bit of a natural not to see it was a yeoman cap.
 27091	Muffled up. Wonder who was that chap at the grave in the brown macin. O,
 27092	the whore of the lane!
 27093	
 27094	A frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew came glazily in the day
 27095	along the quay towards Mr Bloom. When first he saw that form endearing?
 27096	Yes, it is. I feel so lonely. Wet night in the lane. Horn. Who had
 27097	the? Heehaw shesaw. Off her beat here. What is she? Hope she. Psst! Any
 27098	chance of your wash. Knew Molly. Had me decked. Stout lady does be with
 27099	you in the brown costume. Put you off your stroke, that. Appointment
 27100	we made knowing we'd never, well hardly ever. Too dear too near to home
 27101	sweet home. Sees me, does she? Looks a fright in the day. Face like dip.
 27102	Damn her. O, well, she has to live like the rest. Look in here.
 27103	
 27104	In Lionel Marks's antique saleshop window haughty Henry Lionel Leopold
 27105	dear Henry Flower earnestly Mr Leopold Bloom envisaged battered
 27106	candlesticks melodeon oozing maggoty blowbags. Bargain: six bob. Might
 27107	learn to play. Cheap. Let her pass. Course everything is dear if you
 27108	don't want it. That's what good salesman is. Make you buy what he wants
 27109	to sell. Chap sold me the Swedish razor he shaved me with. Wanted to
 27110	charge me for the edge he gave it. She's passing now. Six bob.
 27111	
 27112	Must be the cider or perhaps the burgund.
 27113	
 27114	Near bronze from anear near gold from afar they chinked their clinking
 27115	glasses all, brighteyed and gallant, before bronze Lydia's tempting last
 27116	rose of summer, rose of Castile. First Lid, De, Cow, Ker, Doll, a fifth:
 27117	Lidwell, Si Dedalus, Bob Cowley, Kernan and big Ben Dollard.
 27118	
 27119	Tap. A youth entered a lonely Ormond hall.
 27120	
 27121	Bloom viewed a gallant pictured hero in Lionel Marks's window. Robert
 27122	Emmet's last words. Seven last words. Of Meyerbeer that is.
 27123	
 27124	--True men like you men.
 27125	
 27126	--Ay, ay, Ben.
 27127	
 27128	--Will lift your glass with us.
 27129	
 27130	They lifted.
 27131	
 27132	Tschink. Tschunk.
 27133	
 27134	Tip. An unseeing stripling stood in the door. He saw not bronze. He saw
 27135	not gold. Nor Ben nor Bob nor Tom nor Si nor George nor tanks nor Richie
 27136	nor Pat. Hee hee hee hee. He did not see.
 27137	
 27138	Seabloom, greaseabloom viewed last words. Softly. _When my country takes
 27139	her place among._
 27140	
 27141	Prrprr.
 27142	
 27143	Must be the bur.
 27144	
 27145	Fff! Oo. Rrpr.
 27146	
 27147	_Nations of the earth._ No-one behind. She's passed. _Then and not till
 27148	then._ Tram kran kran kran. Good oppor. Coming. Krandlkrankran. I'm
 27149	sure it's the burgund. Yes. One, two. _Let my epitaph be._ Kraaaaaa.
 27150	_Written. I have._
 27151	
 27152	Pprrpffrrppffff.
 27153	
 27154	_Done._
 27155	
 27156	
 27157	
 27158	I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D. M. P. at the
 27159	corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along
 27160	and he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have
 27161	the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter
 27162	only Joe Hynes.
 27163	
 27164	--Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody
 27165	chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?
 27166	
 27167	--Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?
 27168	
 27169	--Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that
 27170	fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and
 27171	ladders.
 27172	
 27173	--What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.
 27174	
 27175	--Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the
 27176	garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane--old Troy was just giving
 27177	me a wrinkle about him--lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar
 27178	to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a
 27179	hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury
 27180	street.
 27181	
 27182	--Circumcised? says Joe.
 27183	
 27184	--Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm
 27185	hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny
 27186	out of him.
 27187	
 27188	--That the lay you're on now? says Joe.
 27189	
 27190	--Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful
 27191	debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's
 27192	walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain.
 27193	_Tell him,_ says he, _I dare him,_ says he, _and I doubledare him
 27194	to send you round here again or if he does,_ says he, _I'll have
 27195	him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a
 27196	licence._ And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus,
 27197	I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. _He drink me my
 27198	teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?_
 27199	
 27200	For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's
 27201	parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter
 27202	called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty,
 27203	esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward,
 27204	gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds
 27205	avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per
 27206	pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal,
 27207	at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the
 27208	said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value
 27209	received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in
 27210	weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no
 27211	pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or
 27212	pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall
 27213	be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the
 27214	said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the
 27215	said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said
 27216	vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between
 27217	the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one
 27218	part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns
 27219	of the other part.
 27220	
 27221	--Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.
 27222	
 27223	--Not taking anything between drinks, says I.
 27224	
 27225	--What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.
 27226	
 27227	--Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.
 27228	
 27229	--Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.
 27230	
 27231	--Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.
 27232	
 27233	--Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.
 27234	
 27235	--Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?
 27236	
 27237	--Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.
 27238	
 27239	---What was that, Joe? says I.
 27240	
 27241	--Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to
 27242	give the citizen the hard word about it.
 27243	
 27244	So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the
 27245	courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he
 27246	has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over
 27247	that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a
 27248	licence, says he.
 27249	
 27250	In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There
 27251	rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in
 27252	life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land
 27253	it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the
 27254	gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the
 27255	grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse
 27256	fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to
 27257	be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty
 27258	trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty
 27259	sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic
 27260	eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which
 27261	that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close
 27262	proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs
 27263	while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden
 27264	ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings,
 27265	creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes
 27266	voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless
 27267	princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth
 27268	sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of
 27269	the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.
 27270	
 27271	And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen
 27272	by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for
 27273	that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits
 27274	of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain
 27275	descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring
 27276	foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach,
 27277	pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs,
 27278	drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale,
 27279	York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of
 27280	mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red
 27281	green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and
 27282	chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious,
 27283	and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.
 27284	
 27285	I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you
 27286	notorious bloody hill and dale robber!
 27287	
 27288	And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed
 27289	ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers
 27290	and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and
 27291	Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the
 27292	various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus
 27293	heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime
 27294	premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,
 27295	cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,
 27296	champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from
 27297	pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy
 27298	vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and
 27299	lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the
 27300	place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of
 27301	milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and
 27302	targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds,
 27303	various in size, the agate with this dun.
 27304	
 27305	So we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the
 27306	citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that
 27307	bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would
 27308	drop in the way of drink.
 27309	
 27310	--There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his
 27311	load of papers, working for the cause.
 27312	
 27313	The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be
 27314	a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody
 27315	dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a
 27316	constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper
 27317	about a licence.
 27318	
 27319	--Stand and deliver, says he.
 27320	
 27321	--That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.
 27322	
 27323	--Pass, friends, says he.
 27324	
 27325	Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:
 27326	
 27327	--What's your opinion of the times?
 27328	
 27329	Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to
 27330	the occasion.
 27331	
 27332	--I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his
 27333	fork.
 27334	
 27335	So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:
 27336	
 27337	--Foreign wars is the cause of it.
 27338	
 27339	And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:
 27340	
 27341	--It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.
 27342	
 27343	--Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me
 27344	I wouldn't sell for half a crown.
 27345	
 27346	--Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.
 27347	
 27348	--Wine of the country, says he.
 27349	
 27350	--What's yours? says Joe.
 27351	
 27352	--Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.
 27353	
 27354	--Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says
 27355	he.
 27356	
 27357	--Never better, _a chara_, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?
 27358	
 27359	And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck
 27360	and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.
 27361	
 27362	The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was
 27363	that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired
 27364	freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded
 27365	deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed
 27366	hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his
 27367	rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his
 27368	body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in
 27369	hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).
 27370	The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue
 27371	projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous
 27372	obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes
 27373	in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the
 27374	dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath
 27375	issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth
 27376	while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his
 27377	formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of
 27378	the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and
 27379	tremble.
 27380	
 27381	He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching
 27382	to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by
 27383	a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of
 27384	deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased
 27385	in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod
 27386	with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same
 27387	beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every
 27388	movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude
 27389	yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of
 27390	antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages,
 27391	Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill,
 27392	Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell,
 27393	Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy
 27394	Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff,
 27395	Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain
 27396	Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S. Fursa, S. Brendan,
 27397	Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the
 27398	Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for
 27399	Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap,
 27400	The Woman Who Didn't, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L.
 27401	Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir
 27402	Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of
 27403	Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick
 27404	W. Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez,
 27405	Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas
 27406	Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig
 27407	Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly
 27408	Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve,
 27409	Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama
 27410	Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye,
 27411	the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah
 27412	O'Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O'Sullivan Beare. A couched spear of
 27413	acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage
 27414	animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was
 27415	sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and
 27416	spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time
 27417	by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of
 27418	paleolithic stone.
 27419	
 27420	So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the
 27421	sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as
 27422	I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.
 27423	
 27424	--And there's more where that came from, says he.
 27425	
 27426	--Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.
 27427	
 27428	--Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the
 27429	wheeze.
 27430	
 27431	--I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and
 27432	Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.
 27433	
 27434	Who comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom,
 27435	the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the
 27436	prudent soul.
 27437	
 27438	--For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised
 27439	organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this
 27440	blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. _The Irish Independent,_ if
 27441	you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to
 27442	the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent,_ and
 27443	I'll thank you and the marriages.
 27444	
 27445	And he starts reading them out:
 27446	
 27447	--Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's
 27448	on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright
 27449	and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the
 27450	late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and
 27451	Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest,
 27452	dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr,
 27453	Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat
 27454	house, Chepstow...
 27455	
 27456	--I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.
 27457	
 27458	--Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller,
 27459	Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street,
 27460	Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown
 27461	son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?
 27462	
 27463	--Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had
 27464	the start of us. Drink that, citizen.
 27465	
 27466	--I will, says he, honourable person.
 27467	
 27468	--Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.
 27469	
 27470	Ah! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.
 27471	Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.
 27472	
 27473	And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came
 27474	swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him
 27475	there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred
 27476	scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage,
 27477	fairest of her race.
 27478	
 27479	Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's
 27480	snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in
 27481	the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob
 27482	Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the
 27483	door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen
 27484	in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and
 27485	the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a
 27486	poodle. I thought Alf would split.
 27487	
 27488	--Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a
 27489	postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...
 27490	
 27491	And he doubled up.
 27492	
 27493	--Take a what? says I.
 27494	
 27495	--Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.
 27496	
 27497	--O hell! says I.
 27498	
 27499	The bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you
 27500	seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.
 27501	
 27502	_--Bi i dho husht,_ says he.
 27503	
 27504	--Who? says Joe.
 27505	
 27506	--Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round
 27507	to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to
 27508	the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The
 27509	long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old
 27510	lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.
 27511	
 27512	--When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.
 27513	
 27514	--Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?
 27515	
 27516	--Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a
 27517	pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen
 27518	long John's eye. U. p...
 27519	
 27520	And he started laughing.
 27521	
 27522	--Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?
 27523	
 27524	--Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.
 27525	
 27526	Terence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup
 27527	full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and
 27528	Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of
 27529	deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and
 27530	mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour
 27531	juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day
 27532	from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.
 27533	
 27534	Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,
 27535	that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that
 27536	thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.
 27537	
 27538	But he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone
 27539	in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of
 27540	costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen
 27541	the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick,
 27542	Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the
 27543	United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions
 27544	beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even
 27545	she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for
 27546	they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down
 27547	thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.
 27548	
 27549	--What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and
 27550	down outside?
 27551	
 27552	--What's that? says Joe.
 27553	
 27554	--Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging,
 27555	I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.
 27556	
 27557	So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.
 27558	
 27559	--Are you codding? says I.
 27560	
 27561	--Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.
 27562	
 27563	So Joe took up the letters.
 27564	
 27565	--Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.
 27566	
 27567	So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when
 27568	the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:
 27569	
 27570	--How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?
 27571	
 27572	--I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy
 27573	Dignam. Only I was running after that...
 27574	
 27575	--You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?
 27576	
 27577	--With Dignam, says Alf.
 27578	
 27579	--Is it Paddy? says Joe.
 27580	
 27581	--Yes, says Alf. Why?
 27582	
 27583	--Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.
 27584	
 27585	--Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.
 27586	
 27587	--Ay, says Joe.
 27588	
 27589	--Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as
 27590	a pikestaff.
 27591	
 27592	--Who's dead? says Bob Doran.
 27593	
 27594	--You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.
 27595	
 27596	--What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray
 27597	with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam
 27598	dead?
 27599	
 27600	--What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?
 27601	
 27602	--Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.
 27603	
 27604	--Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning
 27605	anyhow.
 27606	
 27607	--Paddy? says Alf.
 27608	
 27609	--Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.
 27610	
 27611	--Good Christ! says Alf.
 27612	
 27613	Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.
 27614	
 27615	In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by
 27616	tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing
 27617	luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of
 27618	the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge
 27619	of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was
 27620	effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery
 27621	and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.
 27622	Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he
 27623	stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still
 27624	submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the
 27625	lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations
 27626	in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a
 27627	glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities
 27628	of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life
 27629	there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard
 27630	from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were
 27631	equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar,
 27632	hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in
 27633	waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of
 27634	buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he
 27635	had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the
 27636	wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported
 27637	in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the
 27638	eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there
 27639	were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was:
 27640	_We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K.
 27641	doesn't pile it on._ It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr
 27642	Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular
 27643	funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been
 27644	responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before
 27645	departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that
 27646	the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the
 27647	commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's
 27648	to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had
 27649	greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly
 27650	requested that his desire should be made known.
 27651	
 27652	Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was
 27653	intimated that this had given satisfaction.
 27654	
 27655	He is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was
 27656	his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with
 27657	your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.
 27658	
 27659	--There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.
 27660	
 27661	--Who? says I.
 27662	
 27663	--Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten
 27664	minutes.
 27665	
 27666	And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.
 27667	
 27668	Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.
 27669	
 27670	--Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.
 27671	
 27672	And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest
 27673	blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:
 27674	
 27675	--Who said Christ is good?
 27676	
 27677	--I beg your parsnips, says Alf.
 27678	
 27679	--Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy
 27680	Dignam?
 27681	
 27682	--Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.
 27683	
 27684	But Bob Doran shouts out of him.
 27685	
 27686	--He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.
 27687	
 27688	Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't
 27689	want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran
 27690	starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.
 27691	
 27692	--The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.
 27693	
 27694	The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter
 27695	for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the
 27696	bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that
 27697	used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was
 27698	stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing
 27699	her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.
 27700	
 27701	--The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy,
 27702	poor little Paddy Dignam.
 27703	
 27704	And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that
 27705	beam of heaven.
 27706	
 27707	Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round
 27708	the door.
 27709	
 27710	--Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.
 27711	
 27712	So Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was
 27713	Martin Cunningham there.
 27714	
 27715	--O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to
 27716	this, will you?
 27717	
 27718	And he starts reading out one.
 27719	
 27720	_7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin._
 27721	
 27722	_Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful
 27723	case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i
 27724	hanged..._
 27725	
 27726	--Show us, Joe, says I.
 27727	
 27728	--_... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in
 27729	Pentonville prison and i was assistant when..._
 27730	
 27731	--Jesus, says I.
 27732	
 27733	--_... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith..._
 27734	
 27735	The citizen made a grab at the letter.
 27736	
 27737	--Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once
 27738	in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my
 27739	terms is five ginnees._
 27740	
 27741	_H. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER._
 27742	
 27743	--And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.
 27744	
 27745	--And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them
 27746	to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?
 27747	
 27748	So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he
 27749	couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well
 27750	he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.
 27751	
 27752	--Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.
 27753	
 27754	And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a
 27755	black border round it.
 27756	
 27757	--They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang
 27758	their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.
 27759	
 27760	And he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his
 27761	heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they
 27762	chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.
 27763	
 27764	In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their
 27765	deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever
 27766	wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so
 27767	saith the Lord.
 27768	
 27769	So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom
 27770	comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the
 27771	business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies
 27772	does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't
 27773	know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.
 27774	
 27775	--There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.
 27776	
 27777	--What's that? says Joe.
 27778	
 27779	--The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.
 27780	
 27781	--That so? says Joe.
 27782	
 27783	--God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in
 27784	
 27785	Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when
 27786	they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like
 27787	a poker.
 27788	
 27789	--Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.
 27790	
 27791	--That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural
 27792	phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...
 27793	
 27794	And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and
 27795	this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.
 27796	
 27797	The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
 27798	medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
 27799	cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
 27800	according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
 27801	calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
 27802	ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
 27803	thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
 27804	dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
 27805	to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
 27806	resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty
 27807	a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
 27808	mortis per diminutionem capitis._
 27809	
 27810	So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and
 27811	he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and
 27812	the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with
 27813	him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for
 27814	the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that
 27815	and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new
 27816	dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round
 27817	the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that
 27818	was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of
 27819	course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:
 27820	
 27821	--Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw
 27822	here! Give us the paw!
 27823	
 27824	Arrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from
 27825	tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking
 27826	all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and
 27827	intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few
 27828	bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to
 27829	bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging
 27830	out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody
 27831	mongrel.
 27832	
 27833	And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the
 27834	brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet
 27835	and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and
 27836	she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown
 27837	cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he
 27838	married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.
 27839	Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there
 27840	was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom
 27841	trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bÃ©zique
 27842	to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a
 27843	Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the
 27844	lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and,
 27845	by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as
 27846	drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of
 27847	alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's
 27848	a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the
 27849	hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing
 27850	the fat. And Bloom with his _but don't you see?_ and _but on the other
 27851	hand_. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after,
 27852	the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five
 27853	times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the
 27854	bloody establishment. Phenomenon!
 27855	
 27856	--The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and
 27857	glaring at Bloom.
 27858	
 27859	--Ay, ay, says Joe.
 27860	
 27861	--You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...
 27862	
 27863	--_Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen. _Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love
 27864	are by our side and the foes we hate before us.
 27865	
 27866	The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far
 27867	and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the
 27868	gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums
 27869	punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening
 27870	claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up
 27871	the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its
 27872	supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain
 27873	poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the
 27874	bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the
 27875	lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin
 27876	Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person
 27877	maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and
 27878	reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on
 27879	their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from
 27880	the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains
 27881	and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our
 27882	country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable
 27883	amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and
 27884	M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual
 27885	mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade
 27886	with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody
 27887	who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity
 27888	will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and
 27889	Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene
 27890	were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment
 27891	and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their
 27892	excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children
 27893	a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included
 27894	many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most
 27895	favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign
 27896	delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated
 27897	on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force,
 27898	consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed
 27899	_doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a
 27900	powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul PetitÃ©patant, the Grandjoker
 27901	Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von
 27902	Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha VirÃ¡ga KisÃ¡szony PutrÃ¡pesthi,
 27903	Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh
 27904	Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras
 27905	y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung
 27906	Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe
 27907	Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus
 27908	Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli,
 27909	Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent
 27910	-generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the
 27911	delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest
 27912	possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which
 27913	they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which
 27914	all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth
 27915	or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's
 27916	patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars,
 27917	boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas,
 27918	catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to
 27919	and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable
 27920	MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly
 27921	restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth
 27922	of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending
 27923	parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all
 27924	and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily
 27925	congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding
 27926	profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from
 27927	underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal
 27928	adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his
 27929	thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the
 27930	pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their
 27931	senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and
 27932	gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their
 27933	rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.
 27934	
 27935	Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless
 27936	morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus
 27937	Cruentus_. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough
 27938	which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate--short,
 27939	painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the
 27940	worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the
 27941	huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in
 27942	their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates
 27943	cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio,
 27944	chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing
 27945	_evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling
 27946	those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured
 27947	our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly
 27948	seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by
 27949	megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's
 27950	patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family
 27951	since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser
 27952	in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last
 27953	comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death
 27954	penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his
 27955	cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace
 27956	fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure
 27957	of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot
 27958	with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered
 27959	furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his
 27960	horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated
 27961	in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the
 27962	admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table
 27963	near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various
 27964	finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the
 27965	worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield),
 27966	a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon,
 27967	blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two
 27968	commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the
 27969	most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and
 27970	dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished
 27971	to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of
 27972	rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious
 27973	hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided
 27974	by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the
 27975	tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced
 27976	the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he,
 27977	with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion
 27978	and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal
 27979	should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and
 27980	indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem.
 27981	The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing
 27982	bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders
 27983	and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be
 27984	launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in
 27985	a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_. Encouraged by
 27986	this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various
 27987	suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb
 27988	permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt
 27989	streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she
 27990	would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his
 27991	lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She
 27992	brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood
 27993	together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the
 27994	innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present,
 27995	they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable
 27996	pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply
 27997	rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped
 27998	their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their
 27999	lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost
 28000	core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the
 28001	aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and
 28002	genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of
 28003	their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye
 28004	in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a
 28005	handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair
 28006	sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook
 28007	and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady,
 28008	requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady
 28009	in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion
 28010	in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous
 28011	act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young
 28012	Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names
 28013	in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancÃ©e_ an
 28014	expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a
 28015	fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the
 28016	ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan
 28017	Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a
 28018	considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching,
 28019	could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet
 28020	he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged
 28021	burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to murmur to
 28022	himself in a faltering undertone:
 28023	
 28024	--God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it
 28025	makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause
 28026	I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.
 28027	
 28028	So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the
 28029	corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak
 28030	their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a
 28031	quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that
 28032	he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the
 28033	antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is
 28034	about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down
 28035	his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth
 28036	of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their
 28037	musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of
 28038	hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly
 28039	blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen
 28040	bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals
 28041	and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh
 28042	entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And
 28043	then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers
 28044	shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two
 28045	sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the
 28046	females, hitting below the belt.
 28047	
 28048	So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty
 28049	starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I
 28050	would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again
 28051	where it wouldn't blind him.
 28052	
 28053	--Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.
 28054	
 28055	--No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.
 28056	
 28057	So he calls the old dog over.
 28058	
 28059	--What's on you, Garry? says he.
 28060	
 28061	Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the
 28062	old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.
 28063	Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that
 28064	has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to
 28065	the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling
 28066	and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the
 28067	hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.
 28068	
 28069	All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the
 28070	lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not
 28071	missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the
 28072	famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of
 28073	Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and
 28074	acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years
 28075	of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system,
 28076	comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our
 28077	greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!)
 28078	has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare
 28079	the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the
 28080	italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not
 28081	speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who
 28082	conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little
 28083	Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as
 28084	a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication
 28085	published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal
 28086	note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and
 28087	of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present
 28088	very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been
 28089	rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we
 28090	are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will
 28091	find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical
 28092	system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative
 28093	and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more
 28094	complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has
 28095	been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly
 28096	increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in
 28097	a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.
 28098	
 28099	     _The curse of my curses
 28100	     Seven days every day
 28101	     And seven dry Thursdays
 28102	     On you, Barney Kiernan,
 28103	     Has no sup of water
 28104	     To cool my courage,
 28105	     And my guts red roaring
 28106	     After Lowry's lights._
 28107	
 28108	So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could
 28109	hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have
 28110	another.
 28111	
 28112	--I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there's no ill feeling.
 28113	
 28114	Gob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one
 28115	pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog
 28116	and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for
 28117	man and beast. And says Joe:
 28118	
 28119	--Could you make a hole in another pint?
 28120	
 28121	--Could a swim duck? says I.
 28122	
 28123	--Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in
 28124	the way of liquid refreshment? says he.
 28125	
 28126	--Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet
 28127	Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's.
 28128	Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't
 28129	serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and
 28130	nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.
 28131	
 28132	--Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is
 28133	landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?
 28134	
 28135	--Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.
 28136	
 28137	--Whose admirers? says Joe.
 28138	
 28139	--The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.
 28140	
 28141	Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act
 28142	like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit
 28143	of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that
 28144	Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow
 28145	contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled
 28146	with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in
 28147	himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a
 28148	friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal
 28149	Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an
 28150	israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.
 28151	
 28152	So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he
 28153	was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and
 28154	to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was
 28155	never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her.
 28156	Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic
 28157	to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.
 28158	
 28159	--Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however
 28160	slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded,
 28161	as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of
 28162	you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve
 28163	let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.
 28164	
 28165	--No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which
 28166	actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to
 28167	me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,
 28168	this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of
 28169	the cup.
 28170	
 28171	--Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart,
 28172	I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words
 28173	the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose
 28174	poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of
 28175	speech.
 28176	
 28177	And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five
 28178	o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the
 28179	bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after
 28180	closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking
 28181	porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls,
 28182	Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving
 28183	mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote
 28184	the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And
 28185	the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody
 28186	fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls
 28187	screeching laughing at one another. _How is your testament? Have you got
 28188	an old testament?_ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then
 28189	see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging
 28190	her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no
 28191	less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's
 28192	sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street
 28193	couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up
 28194	the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.
 28195	
 28196	So Terry brought the three pints.
 28197	
 28198	--Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.
 28199	
 28200	--_Slan leat_, says he.
 28201	
 28202	--Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.
 28203	
 28204	Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small
 28205	fortune to keep him in drinks.
 28206	
 28207	--Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.
 28208	
 28209	--Friend of yours, says Alf.
 28210	
 28211	--Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?
 28212	
 28213	--I won't mention any names, says Alf.
 28214	
 28215	--I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William
 28216	Field, M. P., the cattle traders.
 28217	
 28218	--Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of
 28219	all countries and the idol of his own.
 28220	
 28221	So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease
 28222	and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen
 28223	sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his
 28224	sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the
 28225	guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a
 28226	knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head
 28227	and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot
 28228	for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how
 28229	to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used
 28230	to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out
 28231	with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting
 28232	strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do
 28233	it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor
 28234	animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't
 28235	cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob,
 28236	he'd have a soft hand under a hen.
 28237	
 28238	Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for
 28239	us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then
 28240	comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her
 28241	fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.
 28242	
 28243	--Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London
 28244	to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.
 28245	
 28246	--Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see
 28247	him, as it happens.
 28248	
 28249	--Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.
 28250	
 28251	--That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr
 28252	Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?
 28253	
 28254	--Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question
 28255	tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the
 28256	park. What do you think of that, citizen? _The Sluagh na h-Eireann_.
 28257	
 28258	Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of
 28259	my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right
 28260	honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these
 28261	animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming
 28262	as to their pathological condition?
 28263	
 28264	Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in
 28265	possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole
 28266	house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the
 28267	honourable member's question is in the affirmative.
 28268	
 28269	Mr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued
 28270	for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the
 28271	Phoenix park?
 28272	
 28273	Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.
 28274	
 28275	Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous
 28276	Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury
 28277	bench? (O! O!)
 28278	
 28279	Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.
 28280	
 28281	Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.
 28282	
 28283	(Ironical opposition cheers.)
 28284	
 28285	The speaker: Order! Order!
 28286	
 28287	(The house rises. Cheers.)
 28288	
 28289	--There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There
 28290	he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion
 28291	of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best
 28292	throw, citizen?
 28293	
 28294	--_Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a
 28295	time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.
 28296	
 28297	--Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.
 28298	
 28299	--Is that really a fact? says Alf.
 28300	
 28301	--Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?
 28302	
 28303	So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of
 28304	lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil
 28305	and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom
 28306	had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent
 28307	exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw
 28308	from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom. Do you
 28309	see that straw? That's a straw_. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it
 28310	for an hour so he would and talk steady.
 28311	
 28312	A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian
 28313	O'ciarnain's_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of
 28314	_Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the
 28315	importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and
 28316	ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.
 28317	The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the
 28318	attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by
 28319	the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed,
 28320	a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard
 28321	of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of
 28322	the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The
 28323	wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr
 28324	Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of
 28325	the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening
 28326	by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly
 28327	strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who
 28328	met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the
 28329	negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in
 28330	response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of
 28331	a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal
 28332	Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need
 28333	recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the
 28334	veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction
 28335	to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in
 28336	superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest
 28337	advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing
 28338	it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly
 28339	enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously
 28340	applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many
 28341	prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press
 28342	and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then
 28343	terminated.
 28344	
 28345	Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L.
 28346	L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S.
 28347	Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev.
 28348	P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr.
 28349	Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T.
 28350	Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery,
 28351	V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O.
 28352	M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the
 28353	rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr
 28354	M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M.
 28355	D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy
 28356	canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P.
 28357	Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.
 28358	
 28359	--Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that
 28360	Keogh-Bennett match?
 28361	
 28362	--No, says Joe.
 28363	
 28364	--I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.
 28365	
 28366	--Who? Blazes? says Joe.
 28367	
 28368	And says Bloom:
 28369	
 28370	--What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training
 28371	the eye.
 28372	
 28373	--Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up
 28374	the odds and he swatting all the time.
 28375	
 28376	--We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put
 28377	English gold in his pocket.
 28378	
 28379	---True for you, says Joe.
 28380	
 28381	And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the
 28382	blood, asking Alf:
 28383	
 28384	--Now, don't you think, Bergan?
 28385	
 28386	--Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only
 28387	a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See
 28388	the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God,
 28389	he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made
 28390	him puke what he never ate.
 28391	
 28392	It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled
 28393	to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he
 28394	was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative
 28395	skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both
 28396	champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret
 28397	in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of
 28398	rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the
 28399	pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to
 28400	business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish
 28401	gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of
 28402	Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a
 28403	left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips.
 28404	Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with
 28405	the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose
 28406	right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally
 28407	drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of
 28408	pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was
 28409	a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers
 28410	and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy
 28411	for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.
 28412	After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of
 28413	the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the
 28414	lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to
 28415	Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean
 28416	and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being
 28417	counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the
 28418	towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of
 28419	the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with
 28420	delight.
 28421	
 28422	--He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's
 28423	running a concert tour now up in the north.
 28424	
 28425	--He is, says Joe. Isn't he?
 28426	
 28427	--Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer
 28428	tour, you see. Just a holiday.
 28429	
 28430	--Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.
 28431	
 28432	--My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success
 28433	too.
 28434	
 28435	He's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.
 28436	
 28437	Hoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the
 28438	cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the
 28439	tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island
 28440	bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight
 28441	the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr
 28442	Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the
 28443	bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.
 28444	
 28445	Pride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There
 28446	grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The
 28447	gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed.
 28448	The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.
 28449	
 28450	And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero
 28451	of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned
 28452	in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of
 28453	Lambert.
 28454	
 28455	--Hello, Ned.
 28456	
 28457	--Hello, Alf.
 28458	
 28459	--Hello, Jack.
 28460	
 28461	--Hello, Joe.
 28462	
 28463	--God save you, says the citizen.
 28464	
 28465	--Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?
 28466	
 28467	--Half one, says Ned.
 28468	
 28469	So J. J. ordered the drinks.
 28470	
 28471	--Were you round at the court? says Joe.
 28472	
 28473	--Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.
 28474	
 28475	--Hope so, says Ned.
 28476	
 28477	Now what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list
 28478	and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's.
 28479	Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their
 28480	eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders.
 28481	Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would
 28482	know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing
 28483	his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and
 28484	done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days,
 28485	I'm thinking.
 28486	
 28487	--Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.
 28488	
 28489	--Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.
 28490	
 28491	--Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only
 28492	Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined
 28493	first.
 28494	
 28495	--Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to
 28496	hear him before a judge and jury.
 28497	
 28498	--Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and
 28499	nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.
 28500	
 28501	--Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.
 28502	
 28503	--Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence
 28504	against you.
 28505	
 28506	--Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not
 28507	_compos mentis_. U. p: up.
 28508	
 28509	_--Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy?
 28510	Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat
 28511	on with a shoehorn.
 28512	
 28513	--Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an
 28514	indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.
 28515	
 28516	--Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.
 28517	
 28518	--Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.
 28519	
 28520	--Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half
 28521	and half.
 28522	
 28523	--How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...
 28524	
 28525	--Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish
 28526	nor flesh.
 28527	
 28528	--Nor good red herring, says Joe.
 28529	
 28530	--That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what
 28531	that is.
 28532	
 28533	Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on
 28534	account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the
 28535	old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody
 28536	povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him,
 28537	bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she
 28538	married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the
 28539	pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches,
 28540	the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the
 28541	Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was
 28542	he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a
 28543	week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to
 28544	the world.
 28545	
 28546	--And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to
 28547	be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my
 28548	opinion an action might lie.
 28549	
 28550	Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our
 28551	pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.
 28552	
 28553	--Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.
 28554	
 28555	--Good health, Ned, says J. J.
 28556	
 28557	---There he is again, says Joe.
 28558	
 28559	--Where? says Alf.
 28560	
 28561	And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter
 28562	and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in
 28563	as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a
 28564	secondhand coffin.
 28565	
 28566	--How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.
 28567	
 28568	--Remanded, says J. J.
 28569	
 28570	One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James
 28571	Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers
 28572	saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see
 28573	any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What?
 28574	Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and
 28575	his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew
 28576	Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him,
 28577	swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.
 28578	
 28579	--Who tried the case? says Joe.
 28580	
 28581	--Recorder, says Ned.
 28582	
 28583	--Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.
 28584	
 28585	--Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears
 28586	of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve
 28587	in tears on the bench.
 28588	
 28589	--Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock
 28590	the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for
 28591	the corporation there near Butt bridge.
 28592	
 28593	And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:
 28594	
 28595	--A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?
 28596	Ten, did you say?
 28597	
 28598	--Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.
 28599	
 28600	--And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court
 28601	immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you,
 28602	sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking
 28603	industrious man! I dismiss the case.
 28604	
 28605	And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and
 28606	in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,
 28607	the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first
 28608	quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the
 28609	halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave
 28610	his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the
 28611	probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first
 28612	chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and
 28613	final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of
 28614	the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone,
 28615	an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of
 28616	Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there
 28617	about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at
 28618	the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the
 28619	county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim
 28620	of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of
 28621	Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the
 28622	tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and
 28623	of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of
 28624	Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the
 28625	tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he
 28626	conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and
 28627	truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their
 28628	sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict
 28629	give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And
 28630	they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by
 28631	the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His
 28632	rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from
 28633	their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended
 28634	in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and
 28635	foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge
 28636	against him for he was a malefactor.
 28637	
 28638	--Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland
 28639	filling the country with bugs.
 28640	
 28641	So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe,
 28642	telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first
 28643	but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high
 28644	and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.
 28645	
 28646	--Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have
 28647	repetition. That's the whole secret.
 28648	
 28649	--Rely on me, says Joe.
 28650	
 28651	--Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We
 28652	want no more strangers in our house.
 28653	
 28654	--O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that
 28655	Keyes, you see.
 28656	
 28657	--Consider that done, says Joe.
 28658	
 28659	--Very kind of you, says Bloom.
 28660	
 28661	--The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in.
 28662	We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon
 28663	robbers here.
 28664	
 28665	--Decree _nisi,_ says J. J.
 28666	
 28667	And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a
 28668	spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling
 28669	after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and
 28670	when.
 28671	
 28672	--A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all
 28673	our misfortunes.
 28674	
 28675	--And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_
 28676	with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.
 28677	
 28678	--Give us a squint at her, says I.
 28679	
 28680	And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off
 28681	of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct
 28682	of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds
 28683	pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her
 28684	bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles
 28685	and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be
 28686	late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.
 28687	
 28688	--O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!
 28689	
 28690	--There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off
 28691	of that one, what?
 28692	
 28693	So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on
 28694	him as long as a late breakfast.
 28695	
 28696	--Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action?
 28697	What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide
 28698	about the Irish language?
 28699	
 28700	O'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the
 28701	puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of
 28702	that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient
 28703	city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after
 28704	due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn
 28705	counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into
 28706	honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.
 28707	
 28708	--It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal
 28709	Sassenachs and their _patois._
 28710	
 28711	So J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till
 28712	you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your
 28713	blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach
 28714	a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and
 28715	their colonies and their civilisation.
 28716	
 28717	--Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with
 28718	them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody
 28719	thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature
 28720	worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us.
 28721	Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.
 28722	
 28723	--The European family, says J. J....
 28724	
 28725	--They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin
 28726	Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language
 28727	anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d'aisance._
 28728	
 28729	And says John Wyse:
 28730	
 28731	--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.
 28732	
 28733	And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:
 28734	
 28735	--_Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!_
 28736	
 28737	He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the
 28738	medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh
 28739	Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty
 28740	valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster
 28741	silent as the deathless gods.
 28742	
 28743	--What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had
 28744	lost a bob and found a tanner.
 28745	
 28746	--Gold cup, says he.
 28747	
 28748	--Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.
 28749	
 28750	_--Throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest
 28751	nowhere.
 28752	
 28753	--And Bass's mare? says Terry.
 28754	
 28755	--Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid
 28756	on my tip _Sceptre_ for himself and a lady friend.
 28757	
 28758	--I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on _Zinfandel_ that Mr Flynn
 28759	gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.
 28760	
 28761	--Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. _Throwaway,_
 28762	says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name
 28763	is _Sceptre._
 28764	
 28765	So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was
 28766	anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his
 28767	luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.
 28768	
 28769	--Not there, my child, says he.
 28770	
 28771	--Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the
 28772	other dog.
 28773	
 28774	And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom
 28775	sticking in an odd word.
 28776	
 28777	--Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they
 28778	can't see the beam in their own.
 28779	
 28780	--_Raimeis_, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow
 28781	that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing
 28782	twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost
 28783	tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world!
 28784	And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax
 28785	and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our
 28786	tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our
 28787	Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk
 28788	and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent
 28789	in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the
 28790	Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar
 28791	now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to
 28792	sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even
 28793	Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from
 28794	Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish
 28795	hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for
 28796	the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe
 28797	us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the
 28798	Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and
 28799	bog to make us all die of consumption?
 28800	
 28801	--As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland
 28802	with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.
 28803	Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was
 28804	reading a report of lord Castletown's...
 28805	
 28806	--Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain
 28807	elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the
 28808	trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of
 28809	Eire, O.
 28810	
 28811	--Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.
 28812	
 28813	The fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon
 28814	at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief
 28815	ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine
 28816	Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash,
 28817	Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde
 28818	Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia
 28819	Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs
 28820	Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss
 28821	Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel
 28822	Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall,
 28823	Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana
 28824	Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis
 28825	graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by
 28826	her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in
 28827	a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip
 28828	of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with
 28829	a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by
 28830	bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss
 28831	Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very
 28832	becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being
 28833	worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the
 28834	jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.
 28835	Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability
 28836	and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played
 28837	a new and striking arrangement of _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the
 28838	conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in
 28839	Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a
 28840	playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow,
 28841	ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs
 28842	Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.
 28843	
 28844	--And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with
 28845	Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were
 28846	pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.
 28847	
 28848	--And will again, says Joe.
 28849	
 28850	--And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the
 28851	citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full
 28852	again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom
 28853	of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with
 28854	a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the
 28855	O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with
 28856	the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the
 28857	first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to
 28858	the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat,
 28859	the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue
 28860	field, the three sons of Milesius.
 28861	
 28862	And he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like
 28863	a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody
 28864	life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled
 28865	multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly
 28866	Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the
 28867	holding of an evicted tenant.
 28868	
 28869	--Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?
 28870	
 28871	--An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.
 28872	
 28873	--Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you
 28874	asleep?
 28875	
 28876	--Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.
 28877	
 28878	Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of
 28879	attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to
 28880	crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head
 28881	down like a bull at a gate. And another one: _Black Beast Burned in
 28882	Omaha, Ga_. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a
 28883	Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under
 28884	him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and
 28885	crucify him to make sure of their job.
 28886	
 28887	--But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at
 28888	bay?
 28889	
 28890	--I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is.
 28891	Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on
 28892	the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself
 28893	_Disgusted One_.
 28894	
 28895	So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew
 28896	of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the
 28897	parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad
 28898	brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of
 28899	a gun.
 28900	
 28901	--A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John
 28902	Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on
 28903	the breech.
 28904	
 28905	And says John Wyse:
 28906	
 28907	--'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.
 28908	
 28909	Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane
 28910	and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad
 28911	till he yells meila murder.
 28912	
 28913	--That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the
 28914	earth.
 28915	
 28916	The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber
 28917	on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen
 28918	gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about
 28919	of drudges and whipped serfs.
 28920	
 28921	--On which the sun never rises, says Joe.
 28922	
 28923	--And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The
 28924	unfortunate yahoos believe it.
 28925	
 28926	They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,
 28927	and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,
 28928	born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified,
 28929	flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose
 28930	again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till
 28931	further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.
 28932	
 28933	--But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't
 28934	it be the same here if you put force against force?
 28935	
 28936	Didn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his
 28937	last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.
 28938	
 28939	--We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater
 28940	Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the
 28941	black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid
 28942	low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the
 28943	whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as
 28944	redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the
 28945	Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full
 28946	of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay,
 28947	they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in
 28948	the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember
 28949	the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no
 28950	cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.
 28951	
 28952	--Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...
 28953	
 28954	--We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the
 28955	poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at
 28956	Killala.
 28957	
 28958	--Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us
 28959	against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the
 28960	broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the
 28961	wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan
 28962	in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria
 28963	Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?
 28964	
 28965	--The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know
 28966	what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they
 28967	trying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with
 28968	perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.
 28969	
 28970	--_Conspuez les FranÃ§ais_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.
 28971	
 28972	--And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we
 28973	had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the
 28974	elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?
 28975	
 28976	Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one
 28977	with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of
 28978	God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting
 28979	her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the
 28980	whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_
 28981	and come where the boose is cheaper.
 28982	
 28983	--Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.
 28984	
 28985	--Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox
 28986	than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!
 28987	
 28988	--And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests
 28989	and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic
 28990	Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his
 28991	jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.
 28992	
 28993	--They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little
 28994	Alf.
 28995	
 28996	And says J. J.:
 28997	
 28998	--Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.
 28999	
 29000	--Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.
 29001	
 29002	--Yes, sir, says he. I will.
 29003	
 29004	--You? says Joe.
 29005	
 29006	--Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.
 29007	
 29008	--Repeat that dose, says Joe.
 29009	
 29010	Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with
 29011	his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.
 29012	
 29013	--Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.
 29014	Perpetuating national hatred among nations.
 29015	
 29016	--But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.
 29017	
 29018	--Yes, says Bloom.
 29019	
 29020	--What is it? says John Wyse.
 29021	
 29022	--A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same
 29023	place.
 29024	
 29025	--By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm
 29026	living in the same place for the past five years.
 29027	
 29028	So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck
 29029	out of it:
 29030	
 29031	--Or also living in different places.
 29032	
 29033	--That covers my case, says Joe.
 29034	
 29035	--What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.
 29036	
 29037	--Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.
 29038	
 29039	The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,
 29040	gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.
 29041	
 29042	--After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to
 29043	swab himself dry.
 29044	
 29045	--Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and
 29046	repeat after me the following words.
 29047	
 29048	The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth
 29049	attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors
 29050	of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth
 29051	prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the
 29052	cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each
 29053	of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters
 29054	his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far
 29055	nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing),
 29056	a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted
 29057	on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs
 29058	and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as
 29059	wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo
 29060	illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in
 29061	the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney,
 29062	the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins,
 29063	Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery
 29064	of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's
 29065	banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick
 29066	Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the
 29067	Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail,
 29068	Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice,
 29069	Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college
 29070	refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of
 29071	Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street
 29072	Warehouse, Fingal's Cave--all these moving scenes are still there for us
 29073	today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have
 29074	passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.
 29075	
 29076	--Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?
 29077	
 29078	--That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.
 29079	
 29080	--And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.
 29081	Also now. This very moment. This very instant.
 29082	
 29083	Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.
 29084	
 29085	--Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs
 29086	to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold
 29087	by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.
 29088	
 29089	--Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.
 29090	
 29091	--I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.
 29092	
 29093	--Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.
 29094	
 29095	That's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old
 29096	lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a
 29097	sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And
 29098	then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as
 29099	limp as a wet rag.
 29100	
 29101	--But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not
 29102	life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's
 29103	the very opposite of that that is really life.
 29104	
 29105	--What? says Alf.
 29106	
 29107	--Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says
 29108	he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is
 29109	there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.
 29110	
 29111	Who's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.
 29112	
 29113	--A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.
 29114	
 29115	--Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.
 29116	
 29117	--That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love,
 29118	moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.
 29119	
 29120	Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A
 29121	loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M.
 29122	B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo,
 29123	the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear
 29124	trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the
 29125	brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her
 29126	Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love
 29127	a certain person. And this person loves that other person because
 29128	everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.
 29129	
 29130	--Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power,
 29131	citizen.
 29132	
 29133	--Hurrah, there, says Joe.
 29134	
 29135	--The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.
 29136	
 29137	And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.
 29138	
 29139	--We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.
 29140	What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women
 29141	and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_
 29142	pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit
 29143	in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that's visiting
 29144	England?
 29145	
 29146	--What's that? says Joe.
 29147	
 29148	So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts
 29149	reading out:
 29150	
 29151	--A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented
 29152	yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting,
 29153	Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt
 29154	thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his
 29155	dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which
 29156	the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated
 29157	by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones,
 29158	tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial
 29159	relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that
 29160	he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible,
 29161	the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness,
 29162	graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw
 29163	Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal
 29164	Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the
 29165	toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in
 29166	the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited
 29167	the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors'
 29168	book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the
 29169	course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious
 29170	applause from the girl hands.
 29171	
 29172	--Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that
 29173	bible to the same use as I would.
 29174	
 29175	--Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land
 29176	the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.
 29177	
 29178	--Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.
 29179	
 29180	--No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only
 29181	initialled: P.
 29182	
 29183	--And a very good initial too, says Joe.
 29184	
 29185	--That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.
 29186	
 29187	--Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the
 29188	Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man
 29189	what's this his name is?
 29190	
 29191	--Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.
 29192	
 29193	--Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and
 29194	flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can
 29195	out of them.
 29196	
 29197	--I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.
 29198	
 29199	--Who? says I.
 29200	
 29201	--Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on
 29202	_Throwaway_ and he's gone to gather in the shekels.
 29203	
 29204	--Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a
 29205	horse in anger in his life?
 29206	
 29207	--That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back
 29208	that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.
 29209	Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the
 29210	only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.
 29211	
 29212	--He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.
 29213	
 29214	--Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.
 29215	
 29216	--There you are, says Terry.
 29217	
 29218	Goodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of
 29219	the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was
 29220	letting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I
 29221	to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in
 29222	Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings
 29223	is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was
 29224	telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have
 29225	done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she's
 29226	better_ or _she's_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if
 29227	he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland
 29228	my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's
 29229	the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.
 29230	
 29231	So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it
 29232	was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper
 29233	all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off
 29234	of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk
 29235	about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that
 29236	puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.
 29237	Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody
 29238	mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before
 29239	him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that
 29240	poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country
 29241	with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms.
 29242	Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No
 29243	security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the
 29244	road with every one.
 29245	
 29246	--Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll
 29247	tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.
 29248	
 29249	Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power
 29250	with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of
 29251	the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the
 29252	registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the
 29253	country at the king's expense.
 29254	
 29255	Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their
 29256	palfreys.
 29257	
 29258	--Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.
 29259	Saucy knave! To us!
 29260	
 29261	So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.
 29262	
 29263	Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.
 29264	
 29265	--Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.
 29266	
 29267	--Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds.
 29268	And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.
 29269	
 29270	--Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare
 29271	larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.
 29272	
 29273	--How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant
 29274	countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?
 29275	
 29276	An instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.
 29277	
 29278	--Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's
 29279	messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The
 29280	king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my
 29281	house I warrant me.
 29282	
 29283	--Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty
 29284	trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?
 29285	
 29286	Mine host bowed again as he made answer:
 29287	
 29288	--What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of
 29289	venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head
 29290	with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon
 29291	of old Rhenish?
 29292	
 29293	--Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!
 29294	
 29295	--Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare
 29296	larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.
 29297	
 29298	So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.
 29299	
 29300	--Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.
 29301	
 29302	--Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen
 29303	about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?
 29304	
 29305	--That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.
 29306	
 29307	--Who made those allegations? says Alf.
 29308	
 29309	--I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.
 29310	
 29311	--And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like
 29312	the next fellow?
 29313	
 29314	--Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.
 29315	
 29316	--Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the
 29317	hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.
 29318	
 29319	--Who is Junius? says J. J.
 29320	
 29321	--We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.
 29322	
 29323	--He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was
 29324	he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that
 29325	in the castle.
 29326	
 29327	--Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.
 29328	
 29329	--Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the
 29330	father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the
 29331	father did.
 29332	
 29333	--That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints
 29334	and sages!
 29335	
 29336	--Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that
 29337	matter so are we.
 29338	
 29339	--Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their
 29340	Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till
 29341	he knows if he's a father or a mother.
 29342	
 29343	--Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.
 29344	
 29345	--O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his
 29346	that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a
 29347	tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.
 29348	
 29349	--_En ventre sa mÃ¨re_, says J. J.
 29350	
 29351	--Do you call that a man? says the citizen.
 29352	
 29353	--I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.
 29354	
 29355	--Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.
 29356	
 29357	--And who does he suspect? says the citizen.
 29358	
 29359	Gob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed
 29360	middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a
 29361	month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm
 29362	telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like
 29363	of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it
 29364	would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of
 29365	stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your
 29366	eye.
 29367	
 29368	--Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.
 29369	
 29370	--A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag
 29371	from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.
 29372	
 29373	--Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.
 29374	
 29375	--Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.
 29376	
 29377	--You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.
 29378	
 29379	--Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,
 29380	says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our
 29381	shores.
 29382	
 29383	--Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my
 29384	prayer.
 29385	
 29386	--Amen, says the citizen.
 29387	
 29388	--And I'm sure He will, says Joe.
 29389	
 29390	And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with
 29391	acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and
 29392	subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors
 29393	and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto,
 29394	Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians
 29395	and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines,
 29396	Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter
 29397	Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet
 29398	led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and
 29399	friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers,
 29400	minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of
 29401	Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks
 29402	of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the
 29403	christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And
 29404	after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and
 29405	S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S.
 29406	Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and
 29407	S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde
 29408	and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and
 29409	S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and
 29410	S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence
 29411	and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous
 29412	and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S.
 29413	Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and
 29414	Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S.
 29415	Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S.
 29416	Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S.
 29417	Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany
 29418	and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth
 29419	S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans
 29420	and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S.
 29421	Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr
 29422	and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother
 29423	Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S.
 29424	Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and
 29425	S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and
 29426	the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S.
 29427	Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came
 29428	with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords
 29429	and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of
 29430	their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes,
 29431	trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys,
 29432	dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives,
 29433	soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches,
 29434	forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a
 29435	dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by
 29436	Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain
 29437	street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth
 29438	_Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_
 29439	which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting
 29440	out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the
 29441	halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid,
 29442	interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.
 29443	And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father
 29444	O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers
 29445	had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co,
 29446	limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine
 29447	and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for
 29448	consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed
 29449	the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and
 29450	the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches
 29451	and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with
 29452	blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had
 29453	blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of
 29454	His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the
 29455	beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.
 29456	
 29457	--_Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini._
 29458	
 29459	--_Qui fecit coelum et terram._
 29460	
 29461	--_Dominus vobiscum._
 29462	
 29463	--_Et cum spiritu tuo._
 29464	
 29465	And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed
 29466	and they all with him prayed:
 29467	
 29468	--_Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde
 29469	super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et
 29470	voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem
 29471	sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore
 29472	percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum._
 29473	
 29474	--And so say all of us, says Jack.
 29475	
 29476	--Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.
 29477	
 29478	--Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.
 29479	
 29480	I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when
 29481	be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.
 29482	
 29483	--I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope
 29484	I'm not...
 29485	
 29486	--No, says Martin, we're ready.
 29487	
 29488	Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.
 29489	Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's
 29490	a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to
 29491	five.
 29492	
 29493	--Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,
 29494	
 29495	--Beg your pardon, says he.
 29496	
 29497	--Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.
 29498	
 29499	--Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a
 29500	secret.
 29501	
 29502	And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.
 29503	
 29504	--Bye bye all, says Martin.
 29505	
 29506	And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or
 29507	whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all
 29508	at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.
 29509	
 29510	---Off with you, says
 29511	
 29512	Martin to the jarvey.
 29513	
 29514	The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the
 29515	helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward
 29516	with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew
 29517	nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of
 29518	the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning
 29519	wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the
 29520	equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them
 29521	all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they
 29522	ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did
 29523	they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And
 29524	they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the
 29525	waves.
 29526	
 29527	But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the
 29528	citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the
 29529	dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and
 29530	candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf
 29531	round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.
 29532	
 29533	--Let me alone, says he.
 29534	
 29535	And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls
 29536	out of him:
 29537	
 29538	--Three cheers for Israel!
 29539	
 29540	Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake
 29541	and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's
 29542	always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about
 29543	bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it
 29544	would.
 29545	
 29546	And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and
 29547	Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf
 29548	and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and
 29549	the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit
 29550	down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over
 29551	his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and
 29552	a slut shouts out of her:
 29553	
 29554	--Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!
 29555	
 29556	And says he:
 29557	
 29558	--Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And
 29559	the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.
 29560	
 29561	--He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.
 29562	
 29563	--Whose God? says the citizen.
 29564	
 29565	--Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a
 29566	jew like me.
 29567	
 29568	Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.
 29569	
 29570	--By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy
 29571	name.
 29572	
 29573	By Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.
 29574	
 29575	--Stop! Stop! says Joe.
 29576	
 29577	A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from
 29578	the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid
 29579	farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander
 29580	Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure
 29581	for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of
 29582	Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great _Ã©clat_ was
 29583	characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll
 29584	of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to
 29585	the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the
 29586	community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully
 29587	executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects
 29588	every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob. The departing
 29589	guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were
 29590	present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes
 29591	struck up the wellknown strains of _Come back to Erin_, followed
 29592	immediately by _Rakoczsy's March_. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted
 29593	along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of
 29594	Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of
 29595	Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles
 29596	and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve
 29597	Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the
 29598	welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of
 29599	henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic
 29600	pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from
 29601	the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers
 29602	while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges,
 29603	the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute
 29604	as were also those of the electrical power station at the
 29605	Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. _VisszontlÃ¡tÃ¡sra, kedves barÃ¡ton!
 29606	VisszontlÃ¡tÃ¡sra!_ Gone but not forgotten.
 29607	
 29608	Gob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin
 29609	anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he
 29610	shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's
 29611	royal theatre:
 29612	
 29613	--Where is he till I murder him?
 29614	
 29615	And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.
 29616	
 29617	--Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.
 29618	
 29619	But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other
 29620	way and off with him.
 29621	
 29622	--Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!
 29623	
 29624	Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the
 29625	sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it
 29626	into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old
 29627	mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and
 29628	laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.
 29629	
 29630	The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The
 29631	observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth
 29632	grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar
 29633	seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year
 29634	of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been
 29635	that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and
 29636	parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods
 29637	and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity
 29638	of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself,
 29639	in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in
 29640	progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be
 29641	feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of
 29642	eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by
 29643	a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of
 29644	headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the
 29645	crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle
 29646	with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of
 29647	the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick
 29648	Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties
 29649	in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third
 29650	basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the
 29651	extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near
 29652	the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed
 29653	an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the
 29654	atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest
 29655	by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received
 29656	from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has
 29657	been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_
 29658	shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every
 29659	cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual
 29660	authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful
 29661	departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.
 29662	The work of salvage, removal of _dÃ©bris,_ human remains etc has been
 29663	entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street,
 29664	and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by
 29665	the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the
 29666	general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir
 29667	Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K.
 29668	C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B.
 29669	L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P. I. and F.
 29670	R. C. S. I.
 29671	
 29672	You never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that
 29673	lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he
 29674	would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and
 29675	battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by
 29676	furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And
 29677	he let a volley of oaths after him.
 29678	
 29679	--Did I kill him, says he, or what?
 29680	
 29681	And he shouting to the bloody dog:
 29682	
 29683	--After him, Garry! After him, boy!
 29684	
 29685	And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old
 29686	sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his
 29687	lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.
 29688	Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise
 29689	you.
 29690	
 29691	When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld
 29692	the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in
 29693	the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment
 29694	as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not
 29695	look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah!
 29696	Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai!_ And they
 29697	beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend
 29698	to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over
 29699	Donohoe's in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.
 29700	
 29701	
 29702	
 29703	The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious
 29704	embrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of
 29705	all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud
 29706	promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on
 29707	the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on
 29708	the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness
 29709	the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to
 29710	the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.
 29711	
 29712	The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening
 29713	scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and
 29714	oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy
 29715	chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy
 29716	Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and
 29717	Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with
 29718	caps to match and the name H.M.S. Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy
 29719	and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and
 29720	spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with
 29721	bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They were dabbling in
 29722	the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do,
 29723	or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. And
 29724	Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while
 29725	that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but eleven
 29726	months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just
 29727	beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to
 29728	him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.
 29729	
 29730	--Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of
 29731	water.
 29732	
 29733	And baby prattled after her:
 29734	
 29735	--A jink a jink a jawbo.
 29736	
 29737	Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children,
 29738	so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to
 29739	take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and
 29740	promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden
 29741	syrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby
 29742	Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy
 29743	bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy
 29744	Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with
 29745	a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe
 29746	red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at
 29747	the quaint language of little brother.
 29748	
 29749	But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and
 29750	Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception
 29751	to this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand
 29752	which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go
 29753	wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the
 29754	Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was
 29755	selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman's house
 29756	is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the
 29757	wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle
 29758	too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the
 29759	attention of the girl friends.
 29760	
 29761	--Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,
 29762	Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I
 29763	catch you for that.
 29764	
 29765	His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their
 29766	big sister's word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was
 29767	too after his misadventure. His little man-o'-war top and unmentionables
 29768	were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing
 29769	over life's tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to
 29770	be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening
 29771	with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and
 29772	shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him
 29773	she wouldn't be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.
 29774	
 29775	--Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.
 29776	
 29777	She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:
 29778	
 29779	--What's your name? Butter and cream?
 29780	
 29781	--Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your
 29782	sweetheart?
 29783	
 29784	--Nao, tearful Tommy said.
 29785	
 29786	--Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.
 29787	
 29788	--Nao, Tommy said.
 29789	
 29790	--I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from
 29791	her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy's sweetheart. Gerty is
 29792	Tommy's sweetheart.
 29793	
 29794	--Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.
 29795	
 29796	Cissy's quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to
 29797	Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman
 29798	couldn't see and to mind he didn't wet his new tan shoes.
 29799	
 29800	But who was Gerty?
 29801	
 29802	Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,
 29803	gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen
 29804	of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced
 29805	beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was
 29806	more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful,
 29807	inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking
 29808	of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch's
 29809	female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to
 29810	get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost
 29811	spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine
 29812	Cupid's bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster
 29813	with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments
 29814	could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves
 29815	in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once to
 29816	Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn
 29817	with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to
 29818	time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever
 29819	she did that it was her that told her or she'd never speak to her
 29820	again. No. Honour where honour is due. There was an innate refinement,
 29821	a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced
 29822	in her delicate hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed
 29823	her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had
 29824	she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might
 29825	easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen
 29826	herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors
 29827	at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.
 29828	Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her
 29829	softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning,
 29830	that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm
 29831	few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty's were of
 29832	the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive
 29833	brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It
 29834	was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the
 29835	Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which
 29836	gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders
 29837	of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing
 29838	scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you
 29839	have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because
 29840	she had a button one. But Gerty's crowning glory was her wealth of
 29841	wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut
 29842	it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about
 29843	her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails
 29844	too, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy's words as a telltale
 29845	flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she
 29846	looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God's
 29847	fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.
 29848	
 29849	For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She
 29850	was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.
 29851	Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.
 29852	The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into
 29853	a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May
 29854	morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy
 29855	say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a
 29856	lovers' quarrel. As per usual somebody's nose was out of joint about the
 29857	boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up
 29858	and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in the
 29859	evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was
 29860	on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when
 29861	he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing
 29862	in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he
 29863	perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes,
 29864	piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might learn
 29865	to love her in time. They were protestants in his family and of course
 29866	Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then
 29867	Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and
 29868	he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too
 29869	at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something
 29870	off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his
 29871	hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes
 29872	and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy
 29873	Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn't go and
 29874	ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.
 29875	
 29876	Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of
 29877	Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be
 29878	out. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it
 29879	was expected in the _Lady's Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn)
 29880	with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in
 29881	which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her
 29882	favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy
 29883	threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure
 29884	to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved
 29885	nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and
 29886	at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday week afternoon
 29887	she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she
 29888	wanted at Clery's summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you
 29889	would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by
 29890	herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the
 29891	lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put
 29892	it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the
 29893	shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in
 29894	footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she
 29895	never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash,
 29896	oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over
 29897	her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect
 29898	proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of
 29899	her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and
 29900	wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty's chief care and who
 29901	that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though
 29902	Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to
 29903	blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery,
 29904	three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different
 29905	coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired
 29906	them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed
 29907	them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn't
 29908	trust those washerwomen as far as she'd see them scorching the things.
 29909	She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour
 29910	and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because
 29911	the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father
 29912	brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because
 29913	she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that
 29914	morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that
 29915	was for luck and lovers' meeting if you put those things on inside
 29916	out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it
 29917	wasn't of a Friday.
 29918	
 29919	And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is
 29920	there all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give
 29921	worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where,
 29922	giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup
 29923	feelingsthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before
 29924	the mirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening
 29925	falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns
 29926	in vain. Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a
 29927	marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy
 29928	Wylie T. C. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be
 29929	Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was
 29930	wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox
 29931	was not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in
 29932	love, a woman's birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer's
 29933	(he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole
 29934	an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her
 29935	little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the
 29936	first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from
 29937	the room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of
 29938	character had never been Reggy Wylie's strong point and he who would
 29939	woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always
 29940	waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No
 29941	prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her
 29942	feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found
 29943	his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would
 29944	understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all
 29945	the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long
 29946	long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she yearns this balmy
 29947	summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his
 29948	affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death
 29949	us two part, from this to this day forward.
 29950	
 29951	And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was
 29952	just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his
 29953	little wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in
 29954	the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would
 29955	be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature comforts
 29956	too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that
 29957	feeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and
 29958	queen Ann's pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions
 29959	from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge
 29960	in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction,
 29961	then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though
 29962	she didn't like the eating part when there were any people that made her
 29963	shy and often she wondered why you couldn't eat something poetical like
 29964	violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom
 29965	with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap's
 29966	lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz
 29967	covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery's summer
 29968	jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be tall with
 29969	broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with
 29970	glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache
 29971	and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful
 29972	weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little
 29973	homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but
 29974	perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to
 29975	business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze
 29976	for a moment deep down into her eyes.
 29977	
 29978	Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she
 29979	buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off
 29980	and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy said
 29981	he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the
 29982	ball and if he took it there'd be wigs on the green but Tommy said it
 29983	was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if
 29984	you please. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy
 29985	Caffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off
 29986	now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.
 29987	
 29988	--You're not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It's my ball.
 29989	
 29990	But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her
 29991	finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and
 29992	Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.
 29993	
 29994	--Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.
 29995	
 29996	And she tickled tiny tot's two cheeks to make him forget and played
 29997	here's the lord mayor, here's his two horses, here's his gingerbread
 29998	carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper
 29999	chin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way
 30000	like that from everyone always petting him.
 30001	
 30002	--I'd like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won't
 30003	say.
 30004	
 30005	--On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.
 30006	
 30007	Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy
 30008	saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her
 30009	life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was
 30010	sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared
 30011	Ciss.
 30012	
 30013	--Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of
 30014	her nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I'd look at
 30015	him.
 30016	
 30017	Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes.
 30018	For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and
 30019	jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men's faces on her
 30020	nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go
 30021	where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss
 30022	White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget her the
 30023	evening she dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the burned cork
 30024	moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. There
 30025	was none to come up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself, one of
 30026	the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced
 30027	things, too sweet to be wholesome.
 30028	
 30029	And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing
 30030	anthem of the organ. It was the men's temperance retreat conducted
 30031	by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and
 30032	benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered
 30033	together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying
 30034	spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the
 30035	storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate,
 30036	reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede
 30037	for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. How
 30038	sad to poor Gerty's ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of
 30039	the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit
 30040	cured in Pearson's Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage,
 30041	second to none. Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by
 30042	the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two
 30043	lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at
 30044	the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. But that vile decoction
 30045	which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cist its shadow over her
 30046	childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of
 30047	violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to
 30048	the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was
 30049	one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts
 30050	his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded
 30051	as the lowest of the low.
 30052	
 30053	And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,
 30054	Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard
 30055	her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman
 30056	off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like
 30057	himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him
 30058	any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a
 30059	father because he was too old or something or on account of his face
 30060	(it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the
 30061	pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor
 30062	father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me,
 30063	Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they
 30064	had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby's salad dressing for
 30065	supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that
 30066	died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her
 30067	mother's birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom
 30068	and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have
 30069	had a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he
 30070	was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to
 30071	him for the rest of his days and he couldn't even go to the funeral on
 30072	account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the
 30073	letters and samples from his office about Catesby's cork lino, artistic,
 30074	standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright
 30075	and cheery in the home.
 30076	
 30077	A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the
 30078	house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in
 30079	gold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was
 30080	it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn't
 30081	like her mother's taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single
 30082	thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the
 30083	world of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at
 30084	the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that
 30085	place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr
 30086	Tunney the grocer's christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days
 30087	where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a
 30088	threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with
 30089	oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a
 30090	story behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in
 30091	a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in
 30092	chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them
 30093	dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own
 30094	arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back
 30095	and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker's
 30096	pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the
 30097	halcyon days what they meant.
 30098	
 30099	The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion
 30100	till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was
 30101	no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he
 30102	could down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was
 30103	not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was
 30104	sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted
 30105	the ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and
 30106	to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to
 30107	her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw
 30108	it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and
 30109	stopped right under Gerty's skirt near the little pool by the rock. The
 30110	twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and
 30111	let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their
 30112	stupid ball hadn't come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she
 30113	missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.
 30114	
 30115	--If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.
 30116	
 30117	Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her
 30118	pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted
 30119	her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a
 30120	jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down
 30121	towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw
 30122	attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the
 30123	warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and
 30124	flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of
 30125	the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a
 30126	look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan
 30127	and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.
 30128	
 30129	Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted
 30130	and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of
 30131	original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray
 30132	for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And
 30133	careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many
 30134	who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all
 30135	that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told
 30136	them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the
 30137	most pious Virgin's intercessory power that it was not recorded in any
 30138	age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned
 30139	by her.
 30140	
 30141	The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of
 30142	childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with
 30143	baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep
 30144	she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy
 30145	gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word,
 30146	didn't the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.
 30147	
 30148	--Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.
 30149	
 30150	And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for
 30151	eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of
 30152	health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out
 30153	to be something great, they said.
 30154	
 30155	--Haja ja ja haja.
 30156	
 30157	Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to
 30158	sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried
 30159	out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half
 30160	blanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most
 30161	obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:
 30162	
 30163	--Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.
 30164	
 30165	And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all
 30166	no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the
 30167	geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave
 30168	him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was
 30169	quickly appeased.
 30170	
 30171	Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out
 30172	of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little
 30173	brats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the
 30174	paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured
 30175	chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the
 30176	evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to
 30177	hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned
 30178	in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went
 30179	pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his
 30180	look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through
 30181	and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly
 30182	expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer. She could
 30183	see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he
 30184	was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the
 30185	matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she
 30186	wasn't stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always
 30187	dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had
 30188	an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussÃ©_ from where he was sitting.
 30189	He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting
 30190	sorrow was written on his face. She would have given worlds to know what
 30191	it was. He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the
 30192	ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if
 30193	she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. She was glad
 30194	that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking
 30195	Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which
 30196	she had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy on
 30197	her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he
 30198	was like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him,
 30199	her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had
 30200	suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had
 30201	been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a
 30202	protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved
 30203	her. There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a
 30204	womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known,
 30205	those cyclists showing off what they hadn't got and she just yearned to
 30206	know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her,
 30207	make him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her
 30208	gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her,
 30209	his ownest girlie, for herself alone.
 30210	
 30211	Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. _Ora pro nobis_. Well
 30212	has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy
 30213	can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge
 30214	for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced
 30215	her own heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the
 30216	stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue
 30217	banners of the blessed Virgin's sodality and Father Conroy was helping
 30218	Canon O'Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes
 30219	cast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet
 30220	and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever
 30221	she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to
 30222	the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when
 30223	she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her
 30224	hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the
 30225	voice of nature and we were all subject to nature's laws, he said, in
 30226	this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of
 30227	woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said
 30228	to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word. He
 30229	was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could
 30230	she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a
 30231	present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece
 30232	white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell
 30233	the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours'
 30234	adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or
 30235	perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.
 30236	
 30237	The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky
 30238	threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little
 30239	monkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them
 30240	a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of
 30241	them. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they
 30242	were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.
 30243	
 30244	--Jacky! Tommy!
 30245	
 30246	Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very
 30247	last time she'd ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and
 30248	she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had
 30249	a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the
 30250	thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn't get it to grow
 30251	long because it wasn't natural so she could just go and throw her hat at
 30252	it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn't rip up
 30253	her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot
 30254	of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever
 30255	she thought she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was
 30256	a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her
 30257	petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It
 30258	would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something
 30259	accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to
 30260	make her look tall and got a fine tumble. _Tableau!_ That would have
 30261	been a very charming expose for a gentleman like that to witness.
 30262	
 30263	Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,
 30264	they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed
 30265	the thurible to Canon O'Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the
 30266	Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was
 30267	itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn't
 30268	because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger
 30269	mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that
 30270	he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O'Hanlon handed the
 30271	thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed
 30272	Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just
 30273	swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to
 30274	the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_. Three and eleven she paid for those
 30275	stockings in Sparrow's of George's street on the Tuesday, no the Monday
 30276	before Easter and there wasn't a brack on them and that was what he
 30277	was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had
 30278	neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his
 30279	head to see the difference for himself.
 30280	
 30281	Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with
 30282	her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a
 30283	streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only
 30284	a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat
 30285	hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to
 30286	settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was
 30287	never seen on a girl's shoulders--a radiant little vision, in sooth,
 30288	almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel many a long
 30289	mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She could almost
 30290	see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her
 30291	tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from
 30292	underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath
 30293	caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a
 30294	snake eyes its prey. Her woman's instinct told her that she had raised
 30295	the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat
 30296	to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.
 30297	
 30298	Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,
 30299	half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the
 30300	baby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why
 30301	no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of
 30302	hers. And she said to Gerty:
 30303	
 30304	--A penny for your thoughts.
 30305	
 30306	--What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I
 30307	was only wondering was it late.
 30308	
 30309	Because she wished to goodness they'd take the snottynosed twins and
 30310	their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just
 30311	gave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy
 30312	asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half
 30313	past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because
 30314	they were told to be in early.
 30315	
 30316	--Wait, said Cissy, I'll run ask my uncle Peter over there what's the
 30317	time by his conundrum.
 30318	
 30319	So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his
 30320	hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his
 30321	watchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was
 30322	Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he
 30323	had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the
 30324	next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed
 30325	in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.
 30326	
 30327	Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the
 30328	right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it
 30329	and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his
 30330	watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the
 30331	sun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in
 30332	measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.
 30333	Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said
 30334	his waterworks were out of order.
 30335	
 30336	Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O'Hanlon
 30337	got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told
 30338	Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the
 30339	flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could
 30340	see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she
 30341	swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he
 30342	could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch
 30343	or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands
 30344	back into his pockets. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over
 30345	her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against
 30346	her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too
 30347	was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes
 30348	fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally
 30349	worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a
 30350	man's passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man's face.
 30351	It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.
 30352	
 30353	Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty
 30354	noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect
 30355	because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place
 30356	to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins' caps and tidied
 30357	their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O'Hanlon stood
 30358	up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the
 30359	card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and
 30360	Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her
 30361	but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered
 30362	with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about
 30363	her best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze
 30364	shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt--O
 30365	yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things
 30366	like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.
 30367	Gerty's lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back
 30368	the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully
 30369	moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had loved him
 30370	better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex
 30371	he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant
 30372	there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were
 30373	probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in
 30374	sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.
 30375	
 30376	--O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head
 30377	flashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it's leap year.
 30378	
 30379	Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the
 30380	ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young
 30381	voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As
 30382	for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck
 30383	him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as
 30384	much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen
 30385	pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one
 30386	look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. Miss
 30387	puny little Edy's countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could
 30388	see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering
 30389	rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had
 30390	struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was
 30391	something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and
 30392	never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it
 30393	so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.
 30394	
 30395	Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in
 30396	the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the
 30397	sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told him
 30398	too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby
 30399	looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy
 30400	poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as
 30401	much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to
 30402	his brandnew dribbling bib.
 30403	
 30404	--O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.
 30405	
 30406	The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set
 30407	that little matter to rights.
 30408	
 30409	Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy
 30410	asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was
 30411	flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed
 30412	it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction
 30413	because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet
 30414	seashore because Canon O'Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that
 30415	Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the
 30416	Blessed Sacrament in his hands.
 30417	
 30418	How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse
 30419	of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same
 30420	time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,
 30421	thither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of
 30422	the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of
 30423	paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter
 30424	would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along
 30425	by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the
 30426	lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like
 30427	she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of
 30428	_Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one
 30429	knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from
 30430	Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover
 30431	to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable
 30432	which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously
 30433	neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the
 30434	tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the
 30435	eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change
 30436	when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful
 30437	thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely's of Dame
 30438	Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only
 30439	express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that
 30440	she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the
 30441	potherbs. _Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J Walsh,
 30442	Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou
 30443	ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient
 30444	loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that
 30445	the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one
 30446	shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an
 30447	accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.
 30448	But it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there
 30449	would be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She
 30450	would make the great sacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his
 30451	thoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his
 30452	days with happiness. There was the allimportant question and she was
 30453	dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife
 30454	or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land
 30455	of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.
 30456	But even if--what then? Would it make a very great difference? From
 30457	everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively
 30458	recoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the
 30459	accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and
 30460	coarse men with no respect for a girl's honour, degrading the sex and
 30461	being taken up to the police station. No, no: not that. They would be
 30462	just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other
 30463	in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess. Perhaps it was
 30464	an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She
 30465	thought she understood. She would try to understand him because men were
 30466	so different. The old love was waiting, waiting with little white
 30467	hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! She would
 30468	follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he
 30469	was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was
 30470	the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be
 30471	wild, untrammelled, free.
 30472	
 30473	Canon O'Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and
 30474	genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then
 30475	he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and
 30476	Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn't
 30477	she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:
 30478	
 30479	--O, look, Cissy!
 30480	
 30481	And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the
 30482	trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.
 30483	
 30484	--It's fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.
 30485	
 30486	And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
 30487	helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy
 30488	holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn't fall running.
 30489	
 30490	--Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It's the bazaar fireworks.
 30491	
 30492	But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and
 30493	call. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could
 30494	see from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her
 30495	pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and
 30496	a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face, passion
 30497	silent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were left
 30498	alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could
 30499	be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible
 30500	honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working and a tremour
 30501	went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were
 30502	and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up
 30503	and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her
 30504	graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately
 30505	rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse
 30506	breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that,
 30507	hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made
 30508	her swear she'd never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with
 30509	them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of
 30510	papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do
 30511	something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. But
 30512	this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was
 30513	all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to
 30514	his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. Besides there
 30515	was absolution so long as you didn't do the other thing before being
 30516	married and there ought to be women priests that would understand
 30517	without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy
 30518	kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny
 30519	Rippingham so mad about actors' photographs and besides it was on
 30520	account of that other thing coming on the way it did.
 30521	
 30522	And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back
 30523	and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and
 30524	they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and
 30525	she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was
 30526	flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a
 30527	long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense
 30528	hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and
 30529	higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high,
 30530	high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an
 30531	entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things
 30532	too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than
 30533	those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being
 30534	white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high
 30535	it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from
 30536	being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee
 30537	where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn't ashamed
 30538	and he wasn't either to look in that immodest way like that because he
 30539	couldn't resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like
 30540	those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he
 30541	kept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him chokingly,
 30542	held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on
 30543	her white brow, the cry of a young girl's love, a little strangled cry,
 30544	wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. And then a
 30545	rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle
 30546	burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures
 30547	and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they
 30548	shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so
 30549	lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!
 30550	
 30551	Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She
 30552	glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of
 30553	piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl He
 30554	was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he)
 30555	stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What a
 30556	brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him
 30557	and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been!
 30558	He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes,
 30559	for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and
 30560	wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That was their
 30561	secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to
 30562	know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening
 30563	to and fro and little bats don't tell.
 30564	
 30565	Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show
 30566	what a great person she was: and then she cried:
 30567	
 30568	--Gerty! Gerty! We're going. Come on. We can see from farther up.
 30569	
 30570	Gerty had an idea, one of love's little ruses. She slipped a hand into
 30571	her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of
 30572	course without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he's too
 30573	far to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet
 30574	again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her
 30575	dream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls
 30576	met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full
 30577	of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She
 30578	half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged
 30579	on tears, and then they parted.
 30580	
 30581	Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,
 30582	to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was
 30583	darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and
 30584	slippy seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic
 30585	of her but with care and very slowly because--because Gerty MacDowell
 30586	was...
 30587	
 30588	Tight boots? No. She's lame! O!
 30589	
 30590	Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That's why she's
 30591	left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was
 30592	wrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse
 30593	in a woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn't know it when she was on
 30594	show. Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn't mind. Curiosity like a
 30595	nun or a negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is delicate.
 30596	Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I have such
 30597	a bad headache today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all right. All
 30598	kinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla convent
 30599	that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the end I
 30600	suppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha, she.
 30601	Something in the air. That's the moon. But then why don't all women
 30602	menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends on the
 30603	time they were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out of
 30604	step. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of that.
 30605	Damned glad I didn't do it in the bath this morning over her silly I
 30606	will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this morning. That
 30607	gouger M'Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife engagement in the
 30608	country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for small mercies.
 30609	Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it themselves. Their
 30610	natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.
 30611	Reserve better. Don't want it they throw it at you. Catch em alive, O.
 30612	Pity they can't see themselves. A dream of wellfilled hose. Where was
 30613	that? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping
 30614	Tom. Willy's hat and what the girls did with it. Do they snapshot those
 30615	girls or is it all a fake? _Lingerie_ does it. Felt for the curves
 30616	inside her _deshabillÃ©._ Excites them also when they're. I'm all clean
 30617	come and dirty me. And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice.
 30618	Milly delighted with Molly's new blouse. At first. Put them all on to
 30619	take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her the violet garters. Us too:
 30620	the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers. He wore a pair
 30621	of gaiters the night that first we met. His lovely shirt was shining
 30622	beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she
 30623	takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy lost the pin of her. Dressed up to
 30624	the nines for somebody. Fashion part of their charm. Just changes when
 30625	you're on the track of the secret. Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as
 30626	then. No reasonable offer refused. She wasn't in a hurry either. Always
 30627	off to a fellow when they are. They never forget an appointment. Out on
 30628	spec probably. They believe in chance because like themselves. And the
 30629	others inclined to give her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms
 30630	round each other's necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and
 30631	whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns with
 30632	whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down,
 30633	vindictive too for what they can't get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and
 30634	write to me. And I'll write to you. Now won't you? Molly and Josie
 30635	Powell. Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon.
 30636	_Tableau!_ O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all?
 30637	What have you been doing with yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss,
 30638	to see you. Picking holes in each other's appearance. You're looking
 30639	splendid. Sister souls. Showing their teeth at one another. How many
 30640	have you left? Wouldn't lend each other a pinch of salt.
 30641	
 30642	Ah!
 30643	
 30644	Devils they are when that's coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.
 30645	Molly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my
 30646	foot. O that way! O, that's exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest
 30647	once in a way. Wonder if it's bad to go with them then. Safe in one way.
 30648	Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering plants I
 30649	read in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she's
 30650	a flirt. All are. Daresay she felt 1. When you feel like that you often
 30651	meet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know a
 30652	fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same
 30653	and stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers?
 30654	Suppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss
 30655	in the dark and never tell. Saw something in me. Wonder what. Sooner
 30656	have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair,
 30657	lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid gentleman in literary. Ought to
 30658	attend to my appearance my age. Didn't let her see me in profile. Still,
 30659	you never know. Pretty girls and ugly men marrying. Beauty and the
 30660	beast. Besides I can't be so if Molly. Took off her hat to show her
 30661	hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know
 30662	her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair strong in rut.
 30663	Ten bob I got for Molly's combings when we were on the rocks in Holles
 30664	street. Why not? Suppose he gave her money. Why not? All a prejudice.
 30665	She's worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound. What? I think so. All that for
 30666	nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion. Did I forget to write address on
 30667	that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? And the day I went to
 30668	Drimmie's without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put me off. No,
 30669	I remember. Richie Goulding: he's another. Weighs on his mind. Funny
 30670	my watch stopped at half past four. Dust. Shark liver oil they use to
 30671	clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was that just when he, she?
 30672	
 30673	O, he did. Into her. She did. Done.
 30674	
 30675	Ah!
 30676	
 30677	Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little
 30678	limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not pleasant.
 30679	Still you have to get rid of it someway. They don't care. Complimented
 30680	perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the
 30681	kiddies. Well, aren't they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have
 30682	the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too.
 30683	_Amours_ of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe.
 30684	Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive
 30685	bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel. The strength
 30686	it gives a man. That's the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind
 30687	the wall coming out of Dignam's. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn't
 30688	have. Makes you want to sing after. _Lacaus esant taratara_. Suppose I
 30689	spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you don't know how to end
 30690	the conversation. Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if
 30691	you're stuck. Gain time. But then you're in a cart. Wonderful of course
 30692	if you say: good evening, and you see she's on for it: good evening. O
 30693	but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O
 30694	thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath street that night. All the dirty
 30695	things I made her say. All wrong of course. My arks she called it. It's
 30696	so hard to find one who. Aho! If you don't answer when they solicit must
 30697	be horrible for them till they harden. And kissed my hand when I gave
 30698	her the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press the button and the bird will
 30699	squeak. Wish she hadn't called me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you
 30700	a married man with a single girl! That's what they enjoy. Taking a man
 30701	from another woman. Or even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get
 30702	away from other chap's wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the
 30703	Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in
 30704	my pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime,
 30705	I don't think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is
 30706	beginning. How they change the venue when it's not what they like. Ask
 30707	you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask
 30708	you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.
 30709	Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.
 30710	Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want
 30711	something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must
 30712	have been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since
 30713	she came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick.
 30714	The propitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell
 30715	by their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till
 30716	their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the
 30717	Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts
 30718	were developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we
 30719	drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor
 30720	had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.
 30721	
 30722	There she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up
 30723	like a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must
 30724	be, waiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in
 30725	mother's clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. And
 30726	the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she could
 30727	whistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass whore in
 30728	Jammet's wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind, please, telling
 30729	me the right time? I'll tell you the right time up a dark lane.
 30730	Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.
 30731	Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of course
 30732	they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.
 30733	
 30734	Didn't look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn't give that
 30735	satisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine
 30736	eyes she had, clear. It's the white of the eye brings that out not so
 30737	much the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond
 30738	a dog's jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school
 30739	drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call that
 30740	innocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her. Never see
 30741	them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_. Eyes all over them. Look under
 30742	the bed for what's not there. Longing to get the fright of their lives.
 30743	Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at the corner of
 30744	Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he
 30745	had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that? Typist going up Roger
 30746	Greene's stairs two at a time to show her understandings. Handed down
 30747	from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the bone. Milly for
 30748	example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing. Best
 30749	place for an ad to catch a woman's eye on a mirror. And when I sent
 30750	her for Molly's Paisley shawl to Prescott's by the way that ad I must,
 30751	carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx. I never
 30752	told her. Neat way she carries parcels too. Attract men, small thing
 30753	like that. Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back
 30754	when it was red. Who did you learn that from? Nobody. Something the
 30755	nurse taught me. O, don't they know! Three years old she was in front of
 30756	Molly's dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west. Me have
 30757	a nice pace. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of the world. Young student.
 30758	Straight on her pins anyway not like the other. Still she was game.
 30759	Lord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf. Transparent stockings,
 30760	stretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled
 30761	stockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.
 30762	
 30763	A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads and
 30764	zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and
 30765	Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.
 30766	Will she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion. Darling,
 30767	I saw, your. I saw all.
 30768	
 30769	Lord!
 30770	
 30771	Did me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan's, Dignam's. For
 30772	this relief much thanks. In _Hamlet,_ that is. Lord! It was all things
 30773	combined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt
 30774	of my tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He's right. Might have made a
 30775	worse fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then
 30776	I will tell you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It
 30777	couldn't be? No, Gerty they called her. Might be false name however like
 30778	my name and the address Dolphin's barn a blind.
 30779	
 30780	_Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in
 30781	Irishtown._
 30782	
 30783	Place made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush
 30784	Wiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if
 30785	it understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw
 30786	anything straight at school. Crooked as a ram's horn. Sad however
 30787	because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping
 30788	and papa's pants will soon fit Willy and fuller's earth for the baby
 30789	when they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps
 30790	them out of harm's way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam.
 30791	Children's hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even
 30792	closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds. Oughtn't
 30793	to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up with wind.
 30794	Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan
 30795	there still. She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the
 30796	Coffee Palace. That young doctor O'Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.
 30797	And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable. Worst
 30798	of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. Husband rolling in
 30799	drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. Have that in your nose in
 30800	the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in the morning: was I drunk
 30801	last night? Bad policy however to fault the husband. Chickens come home
 30802	to roost. They stick by one another like glue. Maybe the women's fault
 30803	also. That's where Molly can knock spots off them. It's the blood of the
 30804	south. Moorish. Also the form, the figure. Hands felt for the opulent.
 30805	Just compare for instance those others. Wife locked up at home, skeleton
 30806	in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some
 30807	kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her. Always see a
 30808	fellow's weak point in his wife. Still there's destiny in it, falling
 30809	in love. Have their own secrets between them. Chaps that would go to the
 30810	dogs if some woman didn't take them in hand. Then little chits of girls,
 30811	height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them
 30812	he matched them. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought
 30813	makes one. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May
 30814	and repent in December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the
 30815	foreskin is not back. Better detach.
 30816	
 30817	Ow!
 30818	
 30819	Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and
 30820	the short of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch.
 30821	Wristwatches are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic
 30822	influence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I
 30823	suppose, at once. Cat's away, the mice will play. I remember looking
 30824	in Pill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism.
 30825	Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement.
 30826	And time, well that's the time the movement takes. Then if one thing
 30827	stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it's all
 30828	arranged. Magnetic needle tells you what's going on in the sun, the
 30829	stars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come.
 30830	Come. Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up
 30831	and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you're
 30832	a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you
 30833	have any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.
 30834	
 30835	Wonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third
 30836	person. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw
 30837	stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at
 30838	the horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west.
 30839	Fine voice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did. Like
 30840	flowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the
 30841	paint. Make their own use of everything. Same time doing it scraped her
 30842	slipper on the floor so they wouldn't hear. But lots of them can't kick
 30843	the beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all
 30844	round over me and half down my back.
 30845	
 30846	Wait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That's her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave
 30847	you this to think of me when I'm far away on the pillow. What is it?
 30848	Heliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She'd like scent of that
 30849	kind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her,
 30850	with a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the
 30851	dance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She
 30852	was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good
 30853	conductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there's some connection.
 30854	For instance if you go into a cellar where it's dark. Mysterious thing
 30855	too. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself,
 30856	slow but sure. Suppose it's ever so many millions of tiny grains
 30857	blown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this
 30858	morning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It's like a fine
 30859	fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you
 30860	call it gossamer, and they're always spinning it out of them, fine as
 30861	anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything
 30862	she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little
 30863	kick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff
 30864	in her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too.
 30865	Reminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There
 30866	or the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes
 30867	and corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.
 30868	Muskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years. Dogs
 30869	at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm. Hm.
 30870	Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that way.
 30871	We're the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their
 30872	period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Like
 30873	what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the grass.
 30874	
 30875	Perhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long
 30876	John had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink gives
 30877	that. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because priests
 30878	that are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like flies
 30879	round treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The tree
 30880	of forbidden priest. O, father, will you? Let me be the first to. That
 30881	diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. Source of life. And
 30882	it's extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.
 30883	
 30884	Mr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.
 30885	Almonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that's the soap.
 30886	
 30887	O by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never
 30888	went back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag
 30889	this morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could
 30890	mention Meagher's just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph.
 30891	Two and nine. Bad opinion of me he'll have. Call tomorrow. How much do
 30892	I owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving
 30893	credit another time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run
 30894	up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into
 30895	somewhere else.
 30896	
 30897	Here's this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as
 30898	far as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had a
 30899	good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper walk
 30900	a mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Walk
 30901	after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today. Still you
 30902	learn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as women don't
 30903	mock what matter? That's the way to find out. Ask yourself who is he
 30904	now. _The Mystery Man on the Beach_, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold
 30905	Bloom. Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that fellow
 30906	today at the graveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his kismet
 30907	however. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain they say.
 30908	Must be some somewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp. The body feels the
 30909	atmosphere. Old Betty's joints are on the rack. Mother Shipton's
 30910	prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the twinkling. No. Signs
 30911	of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills seem coming nigh.
 30912	
 30913	Howth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or
 30914	they might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace Darling. People afraid of
 30915	the dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds
 30916	flash better. Women. Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt
 30917	you. Better now of course than long ago. Country roads. Run you through
 30918	the small guts for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against.
 30919	Scowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in
 30920	the shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest. Roygbiv
 30921	Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. A
 30922	star I see. Venus? Can't tell yet. Two. When three it's night. Were
 30923	those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom ship. No.
 30924	Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of the setting
 30925	sun this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native land,
 30926	goodnight.
 30927	
 30928	Dew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white
 30929	fluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his
 30930	way up through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold,
 30931	sore on the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the
 30932	position. Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don't
 30933	know how nice you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green
 30934	apples. Grab at all that offer. Suppose it's the only time we cross
 30935	legs, seated. Also the library today: those girl graduates. Happy chairs
 30936	under them. But it's the evening influence. They feel all that. Open
 30937	like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in
 30938	ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat
 30939	Dillon's garden where I kissed her shoulder. Wish I had a full length
 30940	oilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns.
 30941	History repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I'm with you once again.
 30942	Life, love, voyage round your own little world. And now? Sad about her
 30943	lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity. They
 30944	take advantage.
 30945	
 30946	All quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The
 30947	rhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums, and I the
 30948	plumstones. Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change:
 30949	that's all. Lovers: yum yum.
 30950	
 30951	Tired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of
 30952	me, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it
 30953	comes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the
 30954	same. Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing
 30955	new under the sun. Care of P. O. Dolphin's Barn. Are you not happy in
 30956	your? Naughty darling. At Dolphin's barn charades in Luke Doyle's house.
 30957	Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy,
 30958	Hetty. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the old
 30959	major, partial to his drop of spirits. Curious she an only child, I an
 30960	only child. So it returns. Think you're escaping and run into yourself.
 30961	Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just when he and she.
 30962	Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip: tear in
 30963	Henny Doyle's overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle: cockles and
 30964	periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She leaned on the
 30965	sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow.
 30966	All changed. Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty from the dew.
 30967	
 30968	Ba. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I'm a tree,
 30969	so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you could
 30970	be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he goes.
 30971	Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very
 30972	likely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him
 30973	out, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray
 30974	for us. And pray for us. And pray for us. Good idea the repetition. Same
 30975	thing with ads. Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there's the light in
 30976	the priest's house. Their frugal meal. Remember about the mistake in the
 30977	valuation when I was in Thom's. Twentyeight it is. Two houses they have.
 30978	Gabriel Conroy's brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder why they come out
 30979	at night like mice. They're a mixed breed. Birds are like hopping mice.
 30980	What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit still. All instinct
 30981	like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing
 30982	in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands. Weeny
 30983	bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white. Colours depend
 30984	on the light you see. Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look
 30985	at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants to stamp his trademark on
 30986	everything. Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase. Colour of
 30987	brown turf. Say you never see them with three colours. Not true. That
 30988	half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the _City Arms_ with the letter em on
 30989	her forehead. Body fifty different colours. Howth a while ago amethyst.
 30990	Glass flashing. That's how that wise man what's his name with the
 30991	burning glass. Then the heather goes on fire. It can't be tourists'
 30992	matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and
 30993	light. Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun.
 30994	Archimedes. I have it! My memory's not so bad.
 30995	
 30996	Ba. Who knows what they're always flying for. Insects? That bee last
 30997	week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might
 30998	be the one bit me, come back to see. Birds too. Never find out. Or what
 30999	they say. Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they have
 31000	to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph
 31001	wires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of oceangoing steamers
 31002	floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows. _Faugh a
 31003	Ballagh!_ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of
 31004	a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy
 31005	winds do blow. Married too. Sometimes away for years at the ends of the
 31006	earth somewhere. No ends really because it's round. Wife in every port
 31007	they say. She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching
 31008	home again. If ever he does. Smelling the tail end of ports. How can
 31009	they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor's weighed. Off he sails with
 31010	a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well. And the tephilim no what's
 31011	this they call it poor papa's father had on his door to touch. That
 31012	brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.
 31013	Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know
 31014	what dangers. Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life,
 31015	lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that's the last of his nibs
 31016	till the sharks catch hold of him. Do fish ever get seasick?
 31017	
 31018	Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid,
 31019	crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones' locker, moon looking down so
 31020	peaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.
 31021	
 31022	A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of
 31023	funds for Mercer's hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster
 31024	of violet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The
 31025	shepherd's hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to
 31026	house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o'clock
 31027	postman, the glowworm's lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through
 31028	the laurel hedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock
 31029	lit the lamp at Leahy's terrace. By screens of lighted windows, by equal
 31030	gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening Telegraph, stop
 31031	press edition! Result of the Gold Cup race!_ and from the door of
 31032	Dignam's house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat flew here,
 31033	flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey. Howth
 31034	settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was
 31035	old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.
 31036	He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing,
 31037	slumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship
 31038	twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.
 31039	
 31040	Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish
 31041	Lights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and
 31042	breeches buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in
 31043	the Erin's King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo.
 31044	Filthy trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking overboard
 31045	to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in their faces.
 31046	Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing. Don't know what
 31047	death is at that age. And then their stomachs clean. But being lost they
 31048	fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I didn't want to. Mamma!
 31049	Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with masks too. Throwing them
 31050	up in the air to catch them. I'll murder you. Is it only half fun? Or
 31051	children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can people aim guns at each
 31052	other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and
 31053	nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that. After getting better
 31054	asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What do they love? Another
 31055	themselves? But the morning she chased her with the umbrella. Perhaps so
 31056	as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little hand it was: now big.
 31057	Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when you touch. Loved to count
 31058	my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I remember. Made me laugh to see.
 31059	Little paps to begin with. Left one is more sensitive, I think. Mine
 31060	too. Nearer the heart? Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion. Her
 31061	growing pains at night, calling, wakening me. Frightened she was when
 31062	her nature came on her first. Poor child! Strange moment for the mother
 31063	too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from Buena Vista.
 31064	O'Hara's tower. The seabirds screaming. Old Barbary ape that gobbled all
 31065	his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Looking
 31066	out over the sea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds.
 31067	I always thought I'd marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a
 31068	private yacht. _Buenas noches, seÃ±orita. El hombre ama la muchacha
 31069	hermosa_. Why me? Because you were so foreign from the others.
 31070	
 31071	Better not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you
 31072	dull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for
 31073	_Leah, Lily of Killarney._ No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital
 31074	to see. Hope she's over. Long day I've had. Martha, the bath, funeral,
 31075	house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus' song. Then that
 31076	bawler in Barney Kiernan's. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what
 31077	I said about his God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No.
 31078	Ought to go home and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in
 31079	company. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me. Look
 31080	at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he meant.
 31081	Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked
 31082	about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty. Particularly nice
 31083	old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of the wild man of
 31084	Borneo has just come to town. Imagine that in the early morning at close
 31085	range. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow. But
 31086	Dignam's put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so depressing because
 31087	you never know. Anyhow she wants the money. Must call to those Scottish
 31088	Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for granted we're going to
 31089	pop off first. That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer's that
 31090	looked at me. Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on
 31091	the premium. Her widow's mite. Well? What do you expect her to do? Must
 31092	wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to see. Looks so forlorn. Poor man
 31093	O'Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here. The sewage.
 31094	Hopeless. Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take
 31095	him in tow, platter face and a large apron. Ladies' grey flannelette
 31096	bloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved,
 31097	loved for ever, they say. Ugly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be
 31098	handsome for tomorrow we die. See him sometimes walking about trying to
 31099	find out who played the trick. U. p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also
 31100	a shop often noticed. Curse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait.
 31101	Something confused. She had red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches.
 31102	Suppose she does? Would I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer.
 31103	Nannetti's gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad
 31104	of Keyes's. Work Hynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has
 31105	something to put in them. What's that? Might be money.
 31106	
 31107	Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He
 31108	brought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can't read. Better go.
 31109	Better. I'm tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and
 31110	pebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with
 31111	story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children
 31112	always want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters.
 31113	What's this? Bit of stick.
 31114	
 31115	O! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here
 31116	tomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers do.
 31117	Will I?
 31118	
 31119	Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write a
 31120	message for her. Might remain. What?
 31121	
 31122	I.
 31123	
 31124	Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide
 31125	comes here. Saw a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark
 31126	mirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and
 31127	letters. O, those transparent! Besides they don't know. What is the
 31128	meaning of that other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not
 31129	like.
 31130	
 31131	AM. A.
 31132	
 31133	No room. Let it go.
 31134	
 31135	Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand.
 31136	Nothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here.
 31137	Except Guinness's barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by
 31138	design.
 31139	
 31140	He flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now
 31141	if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn't. Chance.
 31142	We'll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made
 31143	me feel so young.
 31144	
 31145	Short snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone..
 31146	Not even the smoke. And she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I
 31147	won't go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes
 31148	a moment. Won't sleep, though. Half dream. It never comes the same. Bat
 31149	again. No harm in him. Just a few.
 31150	
 31151	O sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me do
 31152	love sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed met

 31157	her next her next.
 31158	
 31159	A bat flew. Here. There. Here. Far in the grey a bell chimed. Mr Bloom
 31160	with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed. Just
 31161	for a few
 31162	
 31163	     _Cuckoo
 31164	     Cuckoo
 31165	     Cuckoo._
 31166	
 31167	The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest's house cooed where Canon
 31168	O'Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S. J. were
 31169	taking tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton chops with catsup
 31170	and talking about
 31171	
 31172	     _Cuckoo
 31173	     Cuckoo
 31174	     Cuckoo._
 31175	
 31176	Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house
 31177	to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there
 31178	because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty
 31179	MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was
 31180	sitting on the rocks looking was
 31181	
 31182	     _Cuckoo
 31183	     Cuckoo
 31184	     Cuckoo._
 31185

 31193	Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa!
 31194	
 31195	Universally that person's acumen is esteemed very little perceptive
 31196	concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by
 31197	mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that
 31198	which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in
 31199	them high mind's ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain
 31200	when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being
 31201	equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more
 31202	efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may
 31203	have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent
 31204	continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately
 31205	present constitutes the certain sign of omnipotent nature's incorrupted
 31206	benefaction. For who is there who anything of some significance has
 31207	apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the
 31208	surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone
 31209	so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature's boon
 31210	can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just
 31211	citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and
 31212	to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently
 31213	commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence
 31214	accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced
 31215	the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of
 31216	profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the
 31217	hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone
 31218	be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously
 31219	command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance
 31220	or with diminution's menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating
 31221	function ever irrevocably enjoined?
 31222	
 31223	It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians
 31224	relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature
 31225	admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.
 31226	Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves,
 31227	their greatest doctors, the O'Shiels, the O'Hickeys, the O'Lees,
 31228	have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the
 31229	relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling
 31230	withering or loose boyconnell flux. Certainly in every public work which
 31231	in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance
 31232	commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having
 31233	preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in
 31234	being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not
 31235	up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so
 31236	far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient
 31237	in that all hardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely
 31238	for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently
 31239	moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and
 31240	for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.
 31241	
 31242	To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be
 31243	molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent
 31244	mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received
 31245	eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the
 31246	case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying
 31247	desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be
 31248	received into that domicile. O thing of prudent nation not merely in
 31249	being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that
 31250	they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly
 31251	to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt!
 31252	
 31253	Before born bliss babe had. Within womb won he worship. Whatever in that
 31254	one case done commodiously done was. A couch by midwives attended with
 31255	wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were
 31256	now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs
 31257	there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her
 31258	case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various
 31259	latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine
 31260	and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence
 31261	conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of
 31262	mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her
 31263	thereto to lie in, her term up.
 31264	
 31265	Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night's oncoming. Of
 31266	Israel's folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark
 31267	ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.
 31268	
 31269	Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming
 31270	mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale
 31271	so God's angel to Mary quoth. Watchers tway there walk, white sisters
 31272	in ward sleepless. Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons
 31273	thrice an hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding
 31274	wariest ward.
 31275	
 31276	In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising
 31277	with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping
 31278	lightens in eyeblink Ireland's westward welkin. Full she drad that
 31279	God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.
 31280	Christ's rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe
 31281	infare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in
 31282	Horne's house.
 31283	
 31284	Loth to irk in Horne's hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow he
 31285	ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land
 31286	and seafloor nine years had long outwandered. Once her in townhithe
 31287	meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved with
 31288	good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so
 31289	young then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes
 31290	his word winning.
 31291	
 31292	As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad
 31293	after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O'Hare Doctor tidings
 31294	sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O'Hare
 31295	Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear that him so
 31296	heavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing death for
 31297	friend so young, algate sore unwilling God's rightwiseness to withsay.
 31298	She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with
 31299	masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men's oil to his limbs.
 31300	The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was
 31301	died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island
 31302	through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God
 31303	the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. He heard her
 31304	sad words, in held hat sad staring. So stood they there both awhile in
 31305	wanhope sorrowing one with other.
 31306	
 31307	Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the
 31308	dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came
 31309	naked forth from his mother's womb so naked shall he wend him at the
 31310	last for to go as he came.
 31311	
 31312	The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and
 31313	he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.
 31314	The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes
 31315	now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear
 31316	but that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she had
 31317	seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman's
 31318	birth. Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man
 31319	that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to her words
 31320	for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail that they have of
 31321	motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for
 31322	any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. Nine
 31323	twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.
 31324	
 31325	And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed
 31326	them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there came
 31327	against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon. And
 31328	the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they
 31329	had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this
 31330	learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be
 31331	healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a
 31332	horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make
 31333	a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he
 31334	said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with
 31335	them that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go
 31336	otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady
 31337	was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well
 31338	that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But
 31339	the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have
 31340	him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous
 31341	castle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him
 31342	for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers
 31343	lands and sometime venery.
 31344	
 31345	And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy
 31346	and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not
 31347	move more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and
 31348	knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white
 31349	flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there
 31350	abound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of
 31351	Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he
 31352	blases in to them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was on
 31353	the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there was
 31354	a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange
 31355	fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible
 31356	thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these fishes lie
 31357	in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness
 31358	that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. And also it was
 31359	a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of
 31360	fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits
 31361	that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. And
 31362	they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks
 31363	out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a
 31364	brewage like to mead.
 31365	
 31366	And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp
 31367	thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe
 31368	Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat
 31369	in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and
 31370	anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and
 31371	his neighbour nist not of this wile. And he sat down in that castle with
 31372	them for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.
 31373	
 31374	This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the
 31375	reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for
 31376	there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied
 31377	fast. Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what
 31378	cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it
 31379	be not come or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware and saw
 31380	a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than
 31381	any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the
 31382	one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full
 31383	gently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His
 31384	bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.
 31385	And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her
 31386	next. Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never
 31387	none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully
 31388	delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both's health for
 31389	he was a passing good man of his lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the
 31390	goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars' hall and that was the meekest
 31391	man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was
 31392	the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service
 31393	to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup. Woman's woe with wonder
 31394	pondering.
 31395	
 31396	Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be
 31397	drunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side
 31398	the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable's
 31399	with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the
 31400	franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and
 31401	young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board
 31402	and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of
 31403	him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the
 31404	most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir
 31405	Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have
 31406	come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.
 31407	And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon
 31408	and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him
 31409	there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that
 31410	time in the honourablest manner. Ruth red him, love led on with will to
 31411	wander, loth to leave.
 31412	
 31413	For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each gen
 31414	other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that
 31415	put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a
 31416	matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne's house that
 31417	now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her
 31418	death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). And
 31419	they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said,
 31420	the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of
 31421	this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had
 31422	conscience to let her die. And not few and of these was young Lynch
 31423	were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never
 31424	other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his
 31425	judges did provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was scant said
 31426	but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife
 31427	should live and the babe to die. In colour whereof they waxed hot
 31428	upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the
 31429	franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the
 31430	least way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the whole
 31431	affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by
 31432	rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of
 31433	Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were
 31434	all wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words following:
 31435	Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and parent now
 31436	glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.
 31437	But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly
 31438	impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord
 31439	and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We are means
 31440	to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.
 31441	Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends. But he had
 31442	overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he
 31443	would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if
 31444	it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. Whereat
 31445	Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi's praise of that beast the
 31446	unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all
 31447	this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice
 31448	him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that
 31449	he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. Thereat
 31450	laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which
 31451	never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would
 31452	not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might
 31453	be or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church
 31454	that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith,
 31455	patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness
 31456	or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the
 31457	influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie
 31458	with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or
 31459	peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses
 31460	Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul
 31461	was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God's
 31462	greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear
 31463	beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman's
 31464	seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages
 31465	founded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like
 31466	case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A wariness of
 31467	mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said
 31468	dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever
 31469	loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his
 31470	experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother
 31471	Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort
 31472	deliverly he scaped their questions. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon,
 31473	and, or I err, a pregnant word. Which hearing young Stephen was a
 31474	marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor
 31475	lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and
 31476	that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.
 31477	
 31478	But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had
 31479	pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour
 31480	and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only
 31481	manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art
 31482	could save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart
 31483	for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of
 31484	lamb's wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and
 31485	lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now Sir
 31486	Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his
 31487	friend's son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and
 31488	as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all
 31489	accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure
 31490	for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and
 31491	murdered his goods with whores.
 31492	
 31493	About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty
 31494	so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed
 31495	their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for
 31496	the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the
 31497	vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink we,
 31498	quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel
 31499	of my body but my soul's bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to them
 31500	that live by bread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for this
 31501	will comfort more than the other will dismay. See ye here. And he showed
 31502	them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of
 31503	two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he
 31504	writ. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of
 31505	money as was herebefore. His words were then these as followeth: Know
 31506	all men, he said, time's ruins build eternity's mansions. What means
 31507	this? Desire's wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a
 31508	bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time. Mark me now. In woman's
 31509	womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh
 31510	that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away. This is the
 31511	postcreation. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_. No question but her name is
 31512	puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd,
 31513	our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly
 31514	that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an
 31515	almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won
 31516	us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are
 31517	linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all,
 31518	seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin. But here is the matter
 31519	now. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her
 31520	creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and
 31521	then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who
 31522	lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of
 31523	the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M. LÃ©o Taxil nous
 31524	a dit que qui l'avait mise dans cette fichue position c'Ã©tait le
 31525	sacre pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_ transubstantiality ODER
 31526	consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality. And all cried out
 31527	upon it for a very scurvy word. A pregnancy without joy, he said, a
 31528	birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.
 31529	Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship. With will will we
 31530	withstand, withsay.
 31531	
 31532	Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would
 31533	sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod
 31534	of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack:
 31535	_The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse
 31536	Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor
 31537	was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all
 31538	orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that
 31539	no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was an
 31540	ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking,
 31541	in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her
 31542	hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them
 31543	all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and
 31544	shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode
 31545	with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou
 31546	chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling,
 31547	thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up
 31548	his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir
 31549	Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain
 31550	gentle, advising also the time's occasion as most sacred and most worthy
 31551	to be most sacred. In Horne's house rest should reign.
 31552	
 31553	To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in
 31554	Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he
 31555	had not cided to take friar's vows and he answered him obedience in the
 31556	womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master
 31557	Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds
 31558	and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue
 31559	of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all
 31560	intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he
 31561	said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was
 31562	the eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more and
 31563	they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and
 31564	deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she
 31565	to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with
 31566	burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and
 31567	the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was
 31568	there unmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those
 31569	delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is
 31570	in their _Maid's Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers:
 31571	_To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable
 31572	concent upon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most
 31573	mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous
 31574	flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium
 31575	of connubial communion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed,
 31576	but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher
 31577	for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen said
 31578	indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them
 31579	and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran
 31580	very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it.
 31581	Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his
 31582	wife for his friend. Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words to that
 31583	effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters
 31584	to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom
 31585	mankind was more beholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it will
 31586	go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed. _Orate, fratres, pro
 31587	memetipso_. And all the people shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy
 31588	generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by
 31589	my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication
 31590	in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou
 31591	sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of
 31592	servants. Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why
 31593	hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for
 31594	a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of
 31595	dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth now,
 31596	my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and
 31597	from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk
 31598	and money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my
 31599	sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left me alone for ever
 31600	in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou
 31601	kissed my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say,
 31602	hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as
 31603	mentioned for the Orient from on high Which brake hell's gates visited a
 31604	darkness that was foraneous. Assuefaction minorates atrocities (as Tully
 31605	saith of his darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no
 31606	blister of combustion. The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt's
 31607	plague which in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their
 31608	most proper _ubi_ and _quomodo_. And as the ends and ultimates of
 31609	all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and
 31610	originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth
 31611	from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing
 31612	and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it
 31613	with our subsolar being. The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail,
 31614	batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they
 31615	bend. First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed
 31616	of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted
 31617	sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage. And as
 31618	no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall
 31619	thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way
 31620	is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness
 31621	the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.
 31622	
 31623	Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly
 31624	bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic
 31625	longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie
 31626	order, a penny for him who finds the pea.
 31627	
 31628	     _Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack
 31629	     See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,
 31630	     In the proud cirque of Jackjohn's bivouac._
 31631	
 31632	A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on
 31633	left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the storm
 31634	that hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and
 31635	witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And
 31636	he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all
 31637	mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift
 31638	was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the
 31639	cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some
 31640	mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which
 31641	Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and
 31642	a blow on any the least colour. But the braggart boaster cried that an
 31643	old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would
 31644	not lag behind his lead. But this was only to dye his desperation as
 31645	cowed he crouched in Horne's hall. He drank indeed at one draught to
 31646	pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all
 31647	the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked
 31648	him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the
 31649	braggart's side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear,
 31650	advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard,
 31651	the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken
 31652	place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.
 31653	
 31654	But was young Boasthard's fear vanquished by Calmer's words? No, for he
 31655	had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be
 31656	done away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the
 31657	other? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But
 31658	could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the
 31659	bottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not
 31660	there to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the
 31661	god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard?
 31662	Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube
 31663	Understanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw that
 31664	he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die
 31665	as he was like the rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to
 31666	die like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though he must nor
 31667	would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon
 31668	has commanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted he nought of that
 31669	other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise
 31670	which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there
 31671	is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall
 31672	come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and
 31673	Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he
 31674	fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she
 31675	said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true
 31676	path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn
 31677	aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so
 31678	flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush
 31679	or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.
 31680	
 31681	This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse
 31682	of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore
 31683	Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a
 31684	wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and
 31685	know her. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else
 31686	but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first,
 31687	Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and
 31688	in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words
 31689	printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by
 31690	Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they
 31691	cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of
 31692	oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring
 31693	that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was
 31694	named Killchild. So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr
 31695	Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon,
 31696	Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company,
 31697	were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a
 31698	very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and
 31699	spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them
 31700	contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.
 31701	
 31702	So Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and
 31703	after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a
 31704	fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won't sprout, fields
 31705	athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.
 31706	Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle
 31707	this long while back as no man remembered to be without. The rosy buds
 31708	all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag
 31709	and faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world saying, for
 31710	aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the
 31711	land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness. But by and
 31712	by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the
 31713	west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the
 31714	weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and
 31715	after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and
 31716	in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking
 31717	shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or
 31718	kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the
 31719	pour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke's lawn, thence through
 31720	Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was
 31721	before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but
 31722	no more crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice
 31723	Fitzgibbon's door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the
 31724	college lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman's gentleman that had but come
 31725	from Mr Moore's the writer's (that was a papish but is now, folk say,
 31726	a good Williamite) chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are
 31727	now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from
 31728	Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M's brother will stay a
 31729	month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there,
 31730	he bound home and he to Andrew Horne's being stayed for to crush a cup
 31731	of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of
 31732	her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and
 31733	so both together on to Horne's. There Leop. Bloom of Crawford's journal
 31734	sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun.,
 31735	scholar of my lady of Mercy's, Vin. Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will. Madden,
 31736	T. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D. Leop. Bloom
 31737	there for a languor he had but was now better, be having dreamed tonight
 31738	a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of
 31739	Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and
 31740	Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now
 31741	on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put
 31742	to it and can't deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a
 31743	shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good
 31744	and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her
 31745	soon issue. 'Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off
 31746	her last chick's nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three
 31747	all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king's bible.
 31748	Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to
 31749	be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour
 31750	dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has
 31751	trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear. In sum
 31752	an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase
 31753	the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come
 31754	for a prognostication of Malachi's almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell
 31755	has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish
 31756	for his farmer's gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere
 31757	fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes
 31758	they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.
 31759	
 31760	With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter
 31761	was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him
 31762	(for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on
 31763	Stephen's persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near
 31764	by which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman that
 31765	went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women,
 31766	horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he was mean
 31767	in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses
 31768	and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul's men, runners,
 31769	flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the
 31770	game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights
 31771	till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose
 31772	gossip. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook's and if he had but gotten
 31773	into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare
 31774	tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue,
 31775	some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother's son of
 31776	them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that is, hearing this
 31777	talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was
 31778	his name), 'tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of
 31779	the plague. But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their
 31780	bully beef, a pox on it. There's as good fish in this tin as ever came
 31781	out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that
 31782	stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place
 31783	which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.
 31784	_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been
 31785	indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he
 31786	spoke French like a gentleman too. From a child this Frank had been
 31787	a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to
 31788	school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at
 31789	the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his
 31790	teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the
 31791	parish beadle than with his volumes. One time he would be a playactor,
 31792	then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit
 31793	and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on
 31794	the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of
 31795	moonlight or fecking maids' linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He
 31796	had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked
 31797	pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint
 31798	of tears as often as he saw him. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands
 31799	across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter
 31800	all? I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool
 31801	boats, says he. I can scarce believe 'tis so bad, says he. And he had
 31802	experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and
 31803	wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe,
 31804	a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow
 31805	auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low's yard in Prussia street. I question with
 31806	you there, says he. More like 'tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr
 31807	Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and
 31808	that he had dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler thanking
 31809	him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the
 31810	bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to
 31811	take the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.
 31812	He'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a
 31813	bull that's Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr
 31814	Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English
 31815	chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was
 31816	sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them
 31817	all, with an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent
 31818	cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper
 31819	and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns
 31820	galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of
 31821	his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and
 31822	rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.
 31823	What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas
 31824	that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who
 31825	were no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my
 31826	cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing, and
 31827	with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the
 31828	blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him
 31829	a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to
 31830	this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper
 31831	in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his
 31832	long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in
 31833	the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they
 31834	dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and
 31835	girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him
 31836	all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of
 31837	the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market
 31838	so that he could doss and dung to his heart's content. By this time the
 31839	father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that
 31840	he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening dames and
 31841	damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his
 31842	belly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their
 31843	ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls' language
 31844	and they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he
 31845	would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself
 31846	(for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up
 31847	on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying:
 31848	By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And,
 31849	says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or
 31850	the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much
 31851	as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he'd run amok over half
 31852	the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all
 31853	by lord Harry's orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says
 31854	Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks
 31855	in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house
 31856	and I'll meddle in his matters, says he. I'll make that animal smell
 31857	hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But
 31858	one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal
 31859	pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for
 31860	himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row
 31861	with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull
 31862	and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry
 31863	he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous
 31864	champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for
 31865	boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his
 31866	head into a cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers
 31867	and pulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the
 31868	water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had
 31869	belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls' language
 31870	to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal
 31871	pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went
 31872	out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what
 31873	took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of
 31874	cotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as
 31875	fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and
 31876	the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as
 31877	the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded
 31878	themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts
 31879	erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three
 31880	sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor,
 31881	ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the
 31882	bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover
 31883	the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the
 31884	composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:
 31885	
 31886	     _--Pope Peter's but a pissabed.
 31887	     A man's a man for a' that._
 31888	
 31889	Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway
 31890	as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend
 31891	whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,
 31892	who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a
 31893	cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil
 31894	enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a
 31895	project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched
 31896	on. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards
 31897	which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell's bearing a legend
 31898	printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and Incubator.
 31899	Lambay Island_. His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw
 31900	from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir
 31901	Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself
 31902	to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. Well,
 31903	let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it
 31904	smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. 'Tis as cheap sitting as
 31905	standing. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon
 31906	his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by
 31907	a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the
 31908	prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal
 31909	vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the
 31910	prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities
 31911	acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch
 31912	defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable
 31913	females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their
 31914	flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly
 31915	bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might
 31916	multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of
 31917	their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he
 31918	assured them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which
 31919	he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with
 31920	certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had
 31921	resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay
 31922	island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of
 31923	note much in favour with our ascendancy party. He proposed to set up
 31924	there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk
 31925	hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful
 31926	yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life
 31927	soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the
 31928	functions of her natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he
 31929	take a penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the
 31930	opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers
 31931	were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.
 31932	For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a
 31933	diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these
 31934	latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both
 31935	broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum
 31936	chillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of
 31937	asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with
 31938	which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the
 31939	rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be
 31940	observed by Mr Mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now
 31941	somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained
 31942	by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of
 31943	Mary's excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also
 31944	to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made court to the
 31945	scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt
 31946	upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his
 31947	contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites,
 31948	ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici
 31949	titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus
 31950	centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder
 31951	wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more
 31952	suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the
 31953	farmyard drake and duck.
 31954	
 31955	Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper
 31956	man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with
 31957	animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics
 31958	while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had
 31959	advanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a
 31960	passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his
 31961	nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom
 31962	were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him
 31963	a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional
 31964	assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very
 31965	heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was
 31966	come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne's house, that was in an
 31967	interesting condition, poor body, from woman's woe (and here he fetched
 31968	a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon,
 31969	to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether
 31970	his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an
 31971	ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,
 31972	as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.
 31973	For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote
 31974	himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll
 31975	mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though
 31976	'tis pity she's a trollop): There's a belly that never bore a bastard.
 31977	This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw
 31978	the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. The spry
 31979	rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the
 31980	antechamber.
 31981	
 31982	Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little
 31983	fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion
 31984	with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient
 31985	point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the
 31986	obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by
 31987	a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had
 31988	not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but
 31989	contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever
 31990	done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. _Mais bien sÃ»r_,
 31991	noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_. That you may
 31992	and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my
 31993	felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet
 31994	and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and
 31995	find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to
 31996	the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good
 31997	things. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a
 31998	complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his
 31999	bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very
 32000	picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.
 32001	Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he
 32002	said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting
 32003	instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her
 32004	feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so
 32005	melting a tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been
 32006	impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of
 32007	such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so
 32008	touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!
 32009	Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her
 32010	favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having
 32011	replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.
 32012	Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great
 32013	and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in
 32014	thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb,
 32015	the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer
 32016	years. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled and
 32017	imperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in
 32018	anguish. Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my
 32019	cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured
 32020	seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me,
 32021	he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and,
 32022	thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz,
 32023	from whom I can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the French fashion
 32024	as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le Fecondateur,
 32025	tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller
 32026	(I have just cracked a half bottle AVEC LUI in a circle of the best wits
 32027	of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they
 32028	have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. A
 32029	drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more
 32030	than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.
 32031	Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are dear at a
 32032	sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten
 32033	such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one. My dear Kitty told me
 32034	today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in
 32035	such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and
 32036	whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy
 32037	butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in
 32038	our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_
 32039	for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a
 32040	breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. The
 32041	first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her
 32042	tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer
 32043	chamber of my ear), the first is a bath... But at this point a bell
 32044	tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for
 32045	the enrichment of our store of knowledge.
 32046	
 32047	Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while
 32048	all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,
 32049	having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with
 32050	a profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a
 32051	party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and
 32052	not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of
 32053	the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of
 32054	ribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.
 32055	A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I'll be sworn she has rendezvoused
 32056	you. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad's bud, immensely
 32057	so, said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater
 32058	hospice. Demme, does not Doctor O'Gargle chuck the nuns there under the
 32059	chin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid
 32060	there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young
 32061	blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest
 32062	squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless
 32063	me, I'm all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you're as bad as dear little Father
 32064	Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried
 32065	Costello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady what's got a
 32066	white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young surgeon, however,
 32067	rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just
 32068	then informed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence
 32069	had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was
 32070	_enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had
 32071	given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those
 32072	who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling
 32073	profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest
 32074	power for happiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if
 32075	need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of
 32076	her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a
 32077	glorious incentive in the human breast. I cannot away with them. What?
 32078	Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of
 32079	her own sex and the astonishment of ours? And at an instant the most
 32080	momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I
 32081	shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice
 32082	have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and
 32083	maid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he
 32084	saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. A murmur
 32085	of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker
 32086	without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would
 32087	he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his
 32088	transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a
 32089	round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew
 32090	breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of
 32091	honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy
 32092	father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty
 32093	pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.
 32094	
 32095	To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of
 32096	some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits
 32097	of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not
 32098	pity. The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies
 32099	as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions
 32100	were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and
 32101	outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were
 32102	they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of
 32103	strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr Costello
 32104	was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that
 32105	seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out
 32106	of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the
 32107	world, which the dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent indeed
 32108	a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of
 32109	creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now
 32110	for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed
 32111	through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary
 32112	ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart
 32113	to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them
 32114	with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude
 32115	of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find
 32116	tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create themselves wits at the
 32117	cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold
 32118	with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit
 32119	the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost
 32120	all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of
 32121	experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious
 32122	retreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring
 32123	nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever
 32124	(as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the
 32125	tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any
 32126	condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful
 32127	occasions. To conclude, while from the sister's words he had reckoned
 32128	upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little
 32129	alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an
 32130	ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to
 32131	the bounty of the Supreme Being.
 32132	
 32133	Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express
 32134	his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express
 32135	one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not
 32136	to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement
 32137	since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy
 32138	young blade said it was her husband's that put her in that expectation
 32139	or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. I
 32140	must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to
 32141	evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round
 32142	again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his
 32143	nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. I
 32144	bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.
 32145	'Slife, I'll be round with you. I cannot but extol the virile potency of
 32146	the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. All fell
 32147	to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young
 32148	blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had
 32149	been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or
 32150	an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. Singular,
 32151	communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of
 32152	metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the
 32153	dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the
 32154	mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a
 32155	pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of
 32156	an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. But,
 32157	he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in
 32158	common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a
 32159	feather laugh together.
 32160	
 32161	But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,
 32162	has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted
 32163	to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our
 32164	internal polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have
 32165	counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary
 32166	advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that
 32167	moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant
 32168	at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he
 32169	forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it that from
 32170	being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is,
 32171	if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from
 32172	candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of
 32173	a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her
 32174	virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his
 32175	interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been
 32176	too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to
 32177	listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of
 32178	the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his
 32179	piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt
 32180	illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata
 32181	of society! Nay, had the hussy's scouringbrush not been her tutelary
 32182	angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the
 32183	question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in
 32184	Mr Cuffe's hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing
 32185	retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill
 32186	becomes him to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield
 32187	that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible
 32188	at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must
 32189	dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste
 32190	to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his
 32191	practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. His
 32192	marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant
 32193	to adduce. The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for
 32194	a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and
 32195	healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in
 32196	its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm
 32197	but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their
 32198	quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid
 32199	and inoperative.
 32200	
 32201	The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial
 32202	usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the
 32203	junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the
 32204	delegation that an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself
 32205	to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the
 32206	afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic
 32207	affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous
 32208	exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and
 32209	solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would
 32210	palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and
 32211	obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of
 32212	tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring
 32213	to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the
 32214	display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among
 32215	tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively
 32216	eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean
 32217	section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form,
 32218	with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs
 32219	Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate
 32220	Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the
 32221	rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and triplets,
 32222	miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac
 32223	_foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia
 32224	of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in
 32225	consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial
 32226	line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the
 32227	benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour
 32228	pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the
 32229	premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the
 32230	actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial
 32231	insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent
 32232	upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in
 32233	the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing
 32234	manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt,_ the
 32235	recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births
 32236	conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in
 32237	a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified
 32238	in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest
 32239	problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much
 32240	animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as
 32241	the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest,
 32242	by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and
 32243	the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and
 32244	ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her
 32245	person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.
 32246	The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro's
 32247	inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a
 32248	_prima facie_ and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded
 32249	(the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired
 32250	infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced
 32251	by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of
 32252	the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic
 32253	development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish
 32254	delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost
 32255	carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males
 32256	of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables
 32257	such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet
 32258	has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression
 32259	made by his words was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily
 32260	as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in
 32261	that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect,
 32262	postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.
 32263	Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate
 32264	Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological
 32265	dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other,
 32266	the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom
 32267	for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent,
 32268	whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity
 32269	of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward
 32270	voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the
 32271	ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has
 32272	joined.
 32273	
 32274	But Malachias' tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up the
 32275	scene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and
 32276	in the recess appeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh
 32277	creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the
 32278	other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted
 32279	on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I anticipated some
 32280	such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems,
 32281	history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer of Samuel
 32282	Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me. This
 32283	is the appearance is on me. Tare and ages, what way would I be resting
 32284	at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back
 32285	with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a
 32286	bullawurrus? My hell, and Ireland's, is in this life. It is what I tried
 32287	to obliterate my crime. Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language
 32288	(he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping
 32289	out. In vain! His spectre stalks me. Dope is my only hope... Ah!
 32290	Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the
 32291	panel slid back. An instant later his head appeared in the door opposite
 32292	and said: Meet me at Westland Row station at ten past eleven. He was
 32293	gone. Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. The seer
 32294	raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The
 32295	sage repeated: _Lex talionis_. The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy
 32296	without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Malachias,
 32297	overcome by emotion, ceased. The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the
 32298	third brother. His real name was Childs. The black panther was himself
 32299	the ghost of his own father. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this
 32300	relief much thanks. The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.
 32301	No soul will live there. The spider pitches her web in the solitude.
 32302	The nocturnal rat peers from his hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted.
 32303	Murderer's ground.
 32304	
 32305	What is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the
 32306	chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the
 32307	merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as
 32308	her mood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing
 32309	the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a
 32310	modest substance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is
 32311	young Leopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within
 32312	a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure of then
 32313	is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old
 32314	house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on
 32315	him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother's
 32316	thought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first
 32317	hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged
 32318	traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented
 32319	handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas!
 32320	a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this
 32321	or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for
 32322	a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his
 32323	studied baisemoins. The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark
 32324	eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission
 32325	to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob's pipe after like labours in
 32326	the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating),
 32327	reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a
 32328	month before. But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young
 32329	knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the
 32330	mist. Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his
 32331	sons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own child. He thinks of a
 32332	drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the
 32333	first. Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine
 32334	and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear
 32335	the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal
 32336	university. Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever
 32337	remember the night: first night, the bridenight. They are entwined
 32338	in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant
 32339	(_fiat_!) light shall flood the world. Did heart leap to heart? Nay,
 32340	fair reader. In a breath 'twas done but--hold! Back! It must not be! In
 32341	terror the poor girl flees away through the murk. She is the bride of
 32342	darkness, a daughter of night. She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe
 32343	of day. No, Leopold. Name and memory solace thee not. That youthful
 32344	illusion of thy strength was taken from thee--and in vain. No son of thy
 32345	loins is by thee. There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was
 32346	for Rudolph.
 32347	
 32348	The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the
 32349	infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions
 32350	of cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight
 32351	ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her
 32352	dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her mother with
 32353	ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight phantoms
 32354	are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely
 32355	haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. They
 32356	fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home of
 32357	screechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more. And
 32358	on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion,
 32359	the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads
 32360	them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. Elk and
 32361	yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come
 32362	trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_. Ominous revengeful zodiacal
 32363	host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the
 32364	trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter
 32365	and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning
 32366	multitude, murderers of the sun.
 32367	
 32368	Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible
 32369	gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portent
 32370	grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven's own
 32371	magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo, wonder
 32372	of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the
 32373	daystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost one,
 32374	Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she now
 32375	arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour,
 32376	shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call
 32377	it gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it
 32378	streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents
 32379	of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling,
 32380	writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad
 32381	metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign
 32382	upon the forehead of Taurus.
 32383	
 32384	Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at
 32385	school together in Conmee's time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,
 32386	Pisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the
 32387	past and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them
 32388	into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to
 32389	my call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending
 32390	bard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair
 32391	with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those
 32392	leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something
 32393	more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius
 32394	father. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to see
 32395	you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. I
 32396	heartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying
 32397	a hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear. He could not leave his
 32398	mother an orphan. The young man's face grew dark. All could see how hard
 32399	it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He
 32400	would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed
 32401	the smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the
 32402	rider's name: Lenehan as much more. He told them of the race. The flag
 32403	fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with 0. Madden
 32404	up. She was leading the field. All hearts were beating. Even Phyllis
 32405	could not contain herself. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah!
 32406	Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close
 32407	order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All
 32408	was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she
 32409	cried, I am undone. But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright
 32410	casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. A
 32411	tear fell: one only. A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane.
 32412	Four winners yesterday and three today. What rider is like him? Mount
 32413	him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter
 32414	is still his. But let us bear it as was the ancient wont. Mercy on the
 32415	luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh. She is not the filly
 32416	that she was. Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. By gad,
 32417	sir, a queen of them. Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could
 32418	have seen my queen today, Vincent said. How young she was and radiant
 32419	(Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of
 32420	muslin, I do not know the right name of it. The chestnuts that shaded
 32421	us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with
 32422	pollen floating by us. In the sunny patches one might easily have
 32423	cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that
 32424	Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had nought
 32425	for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled
 32426	mischievously when I pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four
 32427	days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.
 32428	She is more taking then. Her posies tool Mad romp that she is, she had
 32429	pulled her fill as we reclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you
 32430	will not think who met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was
 32431	walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not,
 32432	a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet
 32433	creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a
 32434	slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the
 32435	very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely
 32436	echo in that little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going
 32437	by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had
 32438	poor luck with Bass's mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more
 32439	propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and
 32440	withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.
 32441	Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far
 32442	away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be
 32443	born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the
 32444	incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos
 32445	told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian
 32446	priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the
 32447	moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha
 32448	of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these
 32449	were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second
 32450	constellation.
 32451	
 32452	However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him
 32453	being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which
 32454	was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was
 32455	not the case at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above
 32456	was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of
 32457	animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody
 32458	that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty
 32459	speedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts
 32460	he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled
 32461	by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated
 32462	amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was
 32463	certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark on account of its
 32464	scarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently
 32465	transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an
 32466	altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment
 32467	before's observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two
 32468	or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as
 32469	mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both
 32470	their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was
 32471	endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined
 32472	to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the
 32473	mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and
 32474	made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the
 32475	same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not
 32476	to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.
 32477	
 32478	The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
 32479	course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The
 32480	debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on
 32481	the loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne's house had never
 32482	beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the
 32483	old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so
 32484	encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at
 32485	the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing
 32486	from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to him,
 32487	was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity
 32488	and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to
 32489	Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose
 32490	the squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant
 32491	before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in
 32492	explorer's kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted
 32493	sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi
 32494	Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young
 32495	poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical
 32496	inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while
 32497	to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator,
 32498	fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the
 32499	dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible
 32500	dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril
 32501	or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous
 32502	loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages
 32503	yet to come.
 32504	
 32505	It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted
 32506	transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) contentions
 32507	would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to
 32508	accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated,
 32509	deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the
 32510	street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain
 32511	them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which
 32512	science cannot answer--at present--such as the first problem submitted
 32513	by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.
 32514	Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary
 32515	(the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth
 32516	of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the
 32517	differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to
 32518	opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig,
 32519	Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to
 32520	a cooperation (one of nature's favourite devices) between the _nisus
 32521	formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily
 32522	chosen position, _succubitus felix_ of the passive element. The other
 32523	problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant
 32524	mortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we
 32525	are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M.
 32526	Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which
 32527	our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by
 32528	inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleged,
 32529	and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity
 32530	posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers
 32531	and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of
 32532	dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas--these, he
 32533	said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of
 32534	the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted
 32535	and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature,
 32536	light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of
 32537	the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured
 32538	photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable
 32539	ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months
 32540	in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes
 32541	some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers
 32542	subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in
 32543	the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official,
 32544	culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal
 32545	abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former
 32546	(we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he
 32547	cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity
 32548	is too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the
 32549	wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they
 32550	do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which
 32551	often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is
 32552	that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and
 32553	mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements,
 32554	lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in
 32555	fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun
 32556	to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our
 32557	public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.
 32558	Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy
 32559	parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs
 32560	unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same
 32561	marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause.
 32562	Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for
 32563	whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law
 32564	of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken
 32565	up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the
 32566	plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an
 32567	increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though
 32568	productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is
 32569	nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the
 32570	race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S.
 32571	Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?)
 32572	that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and
 32573	apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect
 32574	imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females
 32575	emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak
 32576	of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric
 32577	relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought
 32578	else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.
 32579	For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with
 32580	the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and
 32581	embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things
 32582	scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides
 32583	himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in
 32584	the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the
 32585	cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In
 32586	a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took
 32587	place in the commons' hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30
 32588	and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in
 32589	Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported
 32590	by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat
 32591	into the bag (an esthete's allusion, presumably, to one of the most
 32592	complicated and marvellous of all nature's processes--the act of sexual
 32593	congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it,
 32594	to save her own. At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of
 32595	his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured
 32596	tone in which it was delivered.
 32597	
 32598	Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a
 32599	happy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient
 32600	and doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave
 32601	woman had manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and
 32602	now she was very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone
 32603	before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching
 32604	scene. Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight
 32605	in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is
 32606	to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent
 32607	prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her
 32608	loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have
 32609	her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that
 32610	mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now
 32611	(you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet
 32612	in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious
 32613	second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch. O Doady,
 32614	loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that
 32615	faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she
 32616	recalls those days. God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But
 32617	their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers
 32618	and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy,
 32619	Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little
 32620	Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs
 32621	of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a
 32622	Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Young hopeful
 32623	will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of
 32624	Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer's office, Dublin Castle. And so
 32625	time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No, let no sigh
 32626	break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the ashes from
 32627	your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for
 32628	you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read
 32629	in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil
 32630	heart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His own good time. You
 32631	too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. Sir,
 32632	to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant!
 32633	
 32634	There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil
 32635	memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart
 32636	but they abide there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow dim,
 32637	let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself
 32638	that they were not or at least were otherwise. Yet a chance word will
 32639	call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the
 32640	most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel
 32641	and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the
 32642	evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.
 32643	Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under
 32644	her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded
 32645	in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.
 32646	
 32647	The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of
 32648	that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied
 32649	trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an
 32650	unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life. A scene
 32651	disengages itself in the observer's memory, evoked, it would seem, by
 32652	a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present
 32653	there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space
 32654	of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at
 32655	Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but
 32656	with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over
 32657	the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert
 32658	shock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times
 32659	in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey,
 32660	Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in
 32661	her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent
 32662	from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily
 32663	against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey
 32664	(blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long
 32665	the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by
 32666	that circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little just as this young
 32667	man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but
 32668	must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the
 32669	PIAZZETTA giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness
 32670	or of reproach (_alles Vergangliche_) in her glad look.
 32671	
 32672	Mark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that
 32673	antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their
 32674	faces. Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of
 32675	custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant
 32676	watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long
 32677	ago. But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with
 32678	preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended,
 32679	compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field
 32680	and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an
 32681	instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the
 32682	thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the
 32683	transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the
 32684	word.
 32685	
 32686	Burke's! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and
 32687	bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor,
 32688	punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear,
 32689	ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and
 32690	what not. A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there. Nurse
 32691	Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon
 32692	coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a
 32693	milligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They are out,
 32694	tumultuously, off for a minute's race, all bravely legging it, Burke's
 32695	of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows giving them
 32696	sharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with
 32697	nurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up
 32698	there. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward
 32699	of watching in Horne's house has told its tale in that washedout pallor.
 32700	Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers close in
 32701	going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?
 32702	
 32703	The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence
 32704	celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny _coelum._
 32705	God's air, the Allfather's air, scintillant circumambient cessile air.
 32706	Breathe it deep into thee. By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done a
 32707	doughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest progenitor
 32708	barring none in this chaffering allincluding most farraginous chronicle.
 32709	Astounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven preformed possibility which
 32710	thou hast fructified with thy modicum of man's work. Cleave to her!
 32711	Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog and let scholarment and all
 32712	Malthusiasts go hang. Thou art all their daddies, Theodore. Art drooping
 32713	under thy load, bemoiled with butcher's bills at home and ingots (not
 32714	thine!) in the countinghouse? Head up! For every newbegotten thou shalt
 32715	gather thy homer of ripe wheat. See, thy fleece is drenched. Dost envy
 32716	Darby Dullman there with his Joan? A canting jay and a rheumeyed
 32717	curdog is all their progeny. Pshaw, I tell thee! He is a mule, a dead
 32718	gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not worth a cracked kreutzer.
 32719	Copulation without population! No, say I! Herod's slaughter of the
 32720	innocents were the truer name. Vegetables, forsooth, and sterile
 32721	cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw, bleeding! She is a hoary
 32722	pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps, quinsy, bunions, hayfever,
 32723	bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney, Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious
 32724	attacks, gallstones, cold feet, varicose veins. A truce to threnes and
 32725	trentals and jeremies and all such congenital defunctive music! Twenty
 32726	years of it, regret them not. With thee it was not as with many that
 32727	will and would and wait and never--do. Thou sawest thy America, thy
 32728	lifetask, and didst charge to cover like the transpontine bison. How
 32729	saith Zarathustra? _Deine Kuh TrÃ¼bsal melkest Du. Nun Trinkst Du die
 32730	sÃ¼sse Milch des Euters_. See! it displodes for thee in abundance. Drink,
 32731	man, an udderful! Mother's milk, Purefoy, the milk of human kin, milk
 32732	too of those burgeoning stars overhead rutilant in thin rainvapour,
 32733	punch milk, such as those rioters will quaff in their guzzling den, milk
 32734	of madness, the honeymilk of Canaan's land. Thy cow's dug was tough,
 32735	what? Ay, but her milk is hot and sweet and fattening. No dollop this
 32736	but thick rich bonnyclaber. To her, old patriarch! Pap! _Per deam
 32737	Partulam et Pertundam nunc est bibendum_!
 32738

 32907	doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fins. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice

 32909	are wedged lumps of coral and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly.

 32943	candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair

 33018	LYNCH: So that?
 33019

 33021	a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay

 33183	feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom)_ Are you not
 33184	my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold
 33185	who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham
 33186	and Jacob?
 33187	
 33188	BLOOM: _(With precaution)_ I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's
 33189	left of him.
 33190	
 33191	RUDOLPH: _(Severely)_ One night they bring you home drunk as dog after
 33192	spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?
 33193	
 33194	BLOOM: _(In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips,
 33195	narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver
 33196	waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one
 33197	side of him coated with stiffening mud)_ Harriers, father. Only that
 33198	once.
 33199	
 33200	RUDOLPH: Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make
 33201	you kaputt, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.
 33202	
 33203	BLOOM: _(Weakly)_ They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I
 33204	slipped.
 33205	
 33206	RUDOLPH: _(With contempt) Goim nachez_! Nice spectacles for your poor
 33207	mother!
 33208	
 33209	BLOOM: Mamma!
 33210	
 33211	ELLEN BLOOM: _(In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, widow Twankey's
 33212	crinoline and bustle, blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind,
 33213	grey mittens and cameo brooch, her plaited hair in a crispine net,
 33214	appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand,
 33215	and cries out in shrill alarm)_ O blessed Redeemer, what have they done
 33216	to him! My smelling salts! _(She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks
 33217	the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a
 33218	shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out)_ Sacred Heart of Mary,
 33219	where were you at all at all?
 33220	
 33221	_(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in
 33222	his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)_
 33223	
 33224	A VOICE: _(Sharply)_ Poldy!
 33225	
 33226	BLOOM: Who? _(He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily)_ At your service.
 33227	
 33228	_(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in
 33229	Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet
 33230	trousers and jacket, slashed with gold. A wide yellow cummerbund girdles
 33231	her. A white yashmak, violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free
 33232	only her large dark eyes and raven hair.)_
 33233	
 33234	BLOOM: Molly!
 33235	
 33236	MARION: Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to
 33237	me. _(Satirically)_ Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?
 33238	
 33239	BLOOM: _(Shifts from foot to foot)_ No, no. Not the least little bit.
 33240	
 33241	_(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air, questions,
 33242	hopes, crubeens for her supper, things to tell her, excuse, desire,
 33243	spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled
 33244	toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her
 33245	a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of
 33246	innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with
 33247	disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb
 33248	wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)_
 33249	
 33250	MARION: Nebrakada! Femininum!
 33251	
 33252	_(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a large mango fruit,
 33253	offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof, then droops his
 33254	head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops
 33255	his back for leapfrog.)_
 33256	
 33257	BLOOM: I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer... Mrs
 33258	Marion... if you...
 33259	
 33260	MARION: So you notice some change? _(Her hands passing slowly over her
 33261	trinketed stomacher, a slow friendly mockery in her eyes)_ O Poldy,
 33262	Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the
 33263	wide world.
 33264	
 33265	BLOOM: I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower
 33266	water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the
 33267	morning. _(He pats divers pockets)_ This moving kidney. Ah!
 33268	
 33269	_(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon
 33270	soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)_
 33271	
 33272	THE SOAP: We're a capital couple are Bloom and I. He brightens the
 33273	earth. I polish the sky.
 33274	
 33275	
 33276	_(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the
 33277	soapsun.)_
 33278	
 33279	SWENY: Three and a penny, please.
 33280	
 33281	BLOOM: Yes. For my wife. Mrs Marion. Special recipe.
 33282	
 33283	MARION: _(Softly)_ Poldy!
 33284	
 33285	BLOOM: Yes, ma'am?
 33286	
 33287	MARION: _ti trema un poco il cuore?_
 33288	
 33289	_(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon,
 33290	humming the duet from_ Don Giovanni.)
 33291	
 33292	BLOOM: Are you sure about that _voglio_? I mean the pronunciati...
 33293	
 33294	_(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes
 33295	his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)_
 33296	
 33297	THE BAWD: Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched.
 33298	Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.
 33299	
 33300	_(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled, Bridie
 33301	Kelly stands.)_
 33302	
 33303	BRIDIE: Hatch street. Any good in your mind?
 33304	
 33305	_(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues
 33306	with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into
 33307	gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)_
 33308	
 33309	THE BAWD: _(Her wolfeyes shining)_ He's getting his pleasure. You won't
 33310	get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night
 33311	before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.
 33312	
 33313	_(Leering, Gerty Macdowell limps forward. She draws from behind, ogling,
 33314	and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)_
 33315	
 33316	GERTY: With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. _(She murmurs)_ You
 33317	did that. I hate you.
 33318	
 33319	BLOOM: I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.
 33320	
 33321	THE BAWD: Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman
 33322	false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take
 33323	the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.
 33324	
 33325	GERTY: _(To Bloom)_ When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer.
 33326	_(She paws his sleeve, slobbering)_ Dirty married man! I love you for
 33327	doing that to me.
 33328	
 33329	_(She glides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat
 33330	with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes
 33331	wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)_
 33332	
 33333	MRS BREEN: Mr...
 33334	
 33335	BLOOM: _(Coughs gravely)_ Madam, when we last had this pleasure by
 33336	letter dated the sixteenth instant...
 33337	
 33338	MRS BREEN: Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you
 33339	nicely! Scamp!
 33340	
 33341	BLOOM: _(Hurriedly)_ Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think of me?
 33342	Don't give me away. Walls have ears. How do you do? It's ages since I.
 33343	You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having
 33344	this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting
 33345	quarter. Rescue of fallen women. Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...
 33346	
 33347	MRS BREEN: _(Holds up a finger)_ Now, don't tell a big fib! I know
 33348	somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! _(Slily)_
 33349	Account for yourself this very sminute or woe betide you!
 33350	
 33351	BLOOM: _(Looks behind)_ She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming.
 33352	The exotic, you see. Negro servants in livery too if she had money.
 33353	Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at
 33354	the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.
 33355	
 33356	_(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks,
 33357	upstarched Sambo chokers and large scarlet asters in their buttonholes,
 33358	leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands
 33359	jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they
 33360	rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to
 33361	back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)_
 33362	
 33363	TOM AND SAM:
 33364	
 33365	     There's someone in the house with Dina
 33366	     There's someone in the house, I know,
 33367	     There's someone in the house with Dina
 33368	     Playing on the old banjo.
 33369	
 33370	_(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling,
 33371	chortling, trumming, twanging, they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)_
 33372	
 33373	BLOOM: _(With a sour tenderish smile)_ A little frivol, shall we, if
 33374	you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a
 33375	fraction of a second?
 33376	
 33377	MRS BREEN: _(Screams gaily)_ O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!
 33378	
 33379	BLOOM: For old sake' sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage
 33380	mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft
 33381	corner for you. _(Gloomily)_ 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear
 33382	gazelle.
 33383	
 33384	MRS BREEN: Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. _(She
 33385	puts out her hand inquisitively)_ What are you hiding behind your back?
 33386	Tell us, there's a dear.
 33387	
 33388	BLOOM: _(Seizes her wrist with his free hand)_ Josie Powell that was,
 33389	prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking
 33390	back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night, Georgina
 33391	Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game,
 33392	finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this
 33393	snuffbox?
 33394	
 33395	MRS BREEN: You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic
 33396	recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the
 33397	ladies.
 33398	
 33399	BLOOM: _(Squire of dames, in dinner jacket with wateredsilk facings,
 33400	blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl
 33401	studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand)_ Ladies and
 33402	gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.
 33403	
 33404	MRS BREEN: The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.
 33405	
 33406	BLOOM: _(Meaningfully dropping his voice)_ I confess I'm teapot with
 33407	curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot
 33408	at present.
 33409	
 33410	MRS BREEN: _(Gushingly)_ Tremendously teapot! London's teapot and I'm
 33411	simply teapot all over me! _(She rubs sides with him)_ After the parlour
 33412	mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase
 33413	ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.
 33414	
 33415	BLOOM: _(Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his
 33416	fingers and thumb passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which
 33417	she surrenders gently)_ The witching hour of night. I took the splinter
 33418	out of this hand, carefully, slowly. _(Tenderly, as he slips on her
 33419	finger a ruby ring) LÃ  ci darem la mano._
 33420	
 33421	MRS BREEN: _(In a onepiece evening frock executed in moonlight blue, a
 33422	tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside
 33423	her moonblue satin slipper, curves her palm softly, breathing quickly)
 33424	Voglio e non._ You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the
 33425	heart.
 33426	
 33427	BLOOM: When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and
 33428	the beast. I can never forgive you for that. _(His clenched fist at
 33429	his brow)_ Think what it means. All you meant to me then. _(Hoarsely)_
 33430	Woman, it's breaking me!
 33431	
 33432	_(Denis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich-boards,
 33433	shuffles past them in carpet slippers, his dull beard thrust out,
 33434	muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of
 33435	the ace of spades, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)_
 33436	
 33437	ALF BERGAN: _(Points jeering at the sandwichboards)_ U. p: Up.
 33438	
 33439	MRS BREEN: _(To Bloom)_ High jinks below stairs. _(She gives him the
 33440	glad eye)_ Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.
 33441	
 33442	BLOOM: _(Shocked)_ Molly's best friend! Could you?
 33443	
 33444	MRS BREEN: _(Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss)_
 33445	Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?
 33446	
 33447	BLOOM: _(Offhandedly)_ Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without
 33448	potted meat is incomplete. I was at _Leah._ Mrs Bandmann Palmer.
 33449	Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the
 33450	programme. Rattling good place round there for pigs' feet. Feel.
 33451	
 33452	_(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears
 33453	weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which
 33454	a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He opens it
 33455	and shows it full of polonies, kippered herrings, Findon haddies and
 33456	tightpacked pills.)_
 33457	
 33458	RICHIE: Best value in Dub.
 33459	
 33460	_(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his
 33461	napkin, waiting to wait.)_
 33462	
 33463	PAT: _(Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy)_ Steak and
 33464	kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.
 33465	
 33466	RICHIE: Goodgod. Inev erate inall...
 33467	
 33468	_(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by,
 33469	gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)_

 33471	RICHIE: _(With a cry of pain, his hand to his back)_ Ah! Bright's!
 33472	Lights!
 33473	
 33474	BLOOM: _(Ooints to the navvy)_ A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate
 33475	stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.
 33476	
 33477	MRS BREEN: Humbugging and deluthering as per usual with your cock and
 33478	bull story.
 33479	
 33480	BLOOM: I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here.
 33481	But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular
 33482	reason.
 33483	
 33484	MRS BREEN: _(All agog)_ O, not for worlds.
 33485	
 33486	BLOOM: Let's walk on. Shall us?
 33487	
 33488	MRS BREEN: Let's.

 33490	_(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The
 33491	terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)_

 33494	
 33495	BLOOM: _(In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel,
 33496	tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white
 33497	spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in
 33498	bandolier and a grey billycock hat)_ Do you remember a long long time,
 33499	years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was
 33500	weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?
 33501	
 33502	MRS BREEN: _(In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider
 33503	veil)_ Leopardstown.
 33504	
 33505	BLOOM: I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three
 33506	year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old
 33507	fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and
 33508	you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that
 33509	Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and
 33510	eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what
 33511	you like she did it on purpose...
 33512	
 33513	MRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!
 33514	
 33515	BLOOM: Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky
 33516	little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired
 33517	on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a
 33518	pity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a thing with
 33519	a heart the size of a fullstop.
 33520	
 33521	MRS BREEN: _(Squeezes his arm, simpers)_ Naughty cruel I was!
 33522	
 33523	BLOOM: _(Low, secretly, ever more rapidly)_ And Molly was eating a
 33524	sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly,
 33525	though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her
 33526	style. She was...
 33527	
 33528	MRS BREEN: Too...
 33529	
 33530	BLOOM: Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly
 33531	were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses,
 33532	the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses
 33533	was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I
 33534	ever heard or read or knew or came across...
 33535	
 33536	MRS BREEN: _(Eagerly)_ Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
 33537	
 33538	_(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on
 33539	towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her
 33540	feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers
 33541	listen to a tale which their brokensnouted gaffer rasps out with raucous
 33542	humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed
 33543	sodden playfight.)_
 33544	
 33545	THE GAFFER: _(Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout)_ And when Cairns
 33546	came down from the scaffolding in Beaver street what was he after doing
 33547	it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the
 33548	shavings for Derwan's plasterers.

 33553	lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)_

 33556	daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.

 33558	THE LOITERERS: Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the

 33567	     How's your middle leg?
 33568	     Got a match on you?

 33572	_(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From
 33573	a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk.
 33574	In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two
 33575	redcoats.)_
 33576	
 33577	THE NAVVY: _(Belching)_ Where's the bloody house?

 33589	PRIVATE CARR: _(To the navvy)_ Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for
 33590	Carr. Just Carr.
 33591	
 33592	THE NAVVY: _(Shouts)_
 33593	
 33594	We are the boys. Of Wexford.
 33595	
 33596	PRIVATE COMPTON: Say! What price the sergeantmajor?
 33597	
 33598	PRIVATE CARR: Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.
 33599	
 33600	THE NAVVY: _(Shouts)_
 33601	
 33602	     The galling chain.
 33603	     And free our native land.
 33604	
 33605	_(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault.
 33606	The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting)_
 33607	
 33608	BLOOM: Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they
 33609	are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at
 33610	Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far.
 33611	Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding
 33612	for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What
 33613	am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't
 33614	heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have
 33615	met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for
 33616	cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have
 33617	lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only
 33618	for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed
 33619	Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot.
 33620	Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages
 33621	for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff.
 33622	God help his gamekeeper.
 33623	
 33624	_(He gazes ahead, reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend_ Wet Dream
 33625	_and a phallic design._) Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane
 33626	at Kingstown. What's that like? _(Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted
 33627	doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The
 33628	odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling
 33629	wreaths.)_
 33630	
 33631	THE WREATHS: Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.
 33632	
 33633	BLOOM: My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get
 33634	all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too
 33635	much. _(The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand,
 33636	wagging his tail.)_ Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today.
 33637	Better speak to him first. Like women they like _rencontres._ Stinks
 33638	like a polecat. _Chacun son gout_. He might be mad. Dogdays. Uncertain
 33639	in his movements. Good fellow! Fido! Good fellow! Garryowen! _(The
 33640	wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his
 33641	long black tongue lolling out.)_ Influence of his surroundings. Give
 33642	and have done with it. Provided nobody. _(Calling encouraging words he
 33643	shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into
 33644	a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the
 33645	crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.)_ Sizeable for
 33646	threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort.
 33647	Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.
 33648	
 33649	_(With regret he lets the unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The
 33650	mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed,
 33651	crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant.
 33652	They murmur together.)_
 33653	
 33654	THE WATCH: Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.
 33655	
 33656	_(Each lays hand on Bloom's shoulder.)_
 33657	
 33658	FIRST WATCH: Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.
 33659	
 33660	BLOOM: _(Stammers)_ I am doing good to others.
 33661	
 33662	_(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with
 33663	Banbury cakes in their beaks.)_
 33664	
 33665	THE GULLS: Kaw kave kankury kake.
 33666	
 33667	BLOOM: The friend of man. Trained by kindness.
 33668	
 33669	_(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high barstool, sways over the
 33670	munching spaniel.)_
 33671	
 33672	BOB DORAN: Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.
 33673	
 33674	_(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pig's knuckle
 33675	between his molars through which rabid scumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran
 33676	fills silently into an area.)_
 33677	
 33678	SECOND WATCH: Prevention of cruelty to animals.
 33679	
 33680	BLOOM: _(Enthusiastically)_ A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on
 33681	Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab.
 33682	Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last
 33683	tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.
 33684	
 33685	_(Signor Maffei, passionpale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs
 33686	in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paperhoop, a
 33687	curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the gorging
 33688	boarhound.)_
 33689	
 33690	SIGNOR MAFFEI: _(With a sinister smile)_ Ladies and gentlemen, my
 33691	educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my
 33692	patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted
 33693	thong. Block tackle and a strangling pulley will bring your lion to
 33694	heel, no matter how fractious, even _Leo ferox_ there, the Libyan
 33695	maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part
 33696	produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. _(He glares)_ I possess
 33697	the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers.
 33698	_(With a bewitching smile)_ I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride
 33699	of the ring.
 33700	
 33701	FIRST WATCH: Come. Name and address.
 33702	
 33703	BLOOM: I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! _(He takes off his high
 33704	grade hat, saluting)_ Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard
 33705	of von Blum Pasha. Umpteen millions. _Donnerwetter!_ Owns half Austria.
 33706	Egypt. Cousin.
 33707	
 33708	FIRST WATCH: Proof.
 33709	
 33710	_(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)_
 33711	
 33712	BLOOM: _(In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing
 33713	a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and
 33714	offers it)_ Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors:
 33715	Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.
 33716	
 33717	FIRST WATCH: _(Reads)_ Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Unlawfully watching
 33718	and besetting.
 33719	
 33720	SECOND WATCH: An alibi. You are cautioned.
 33721	
 33722	BLOOM: _(Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower)_ This
 33723	is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his
 33724	name. _(Plausibly)_ You know that old joke, rose of Castile. Bloom. The
 33725	change of name. Virag. _(He murmurs privately and confidentially)_ We
 33726	are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. _(He
 33727	shoulders the second watch gently)_ Dash it all. It's a way we gallants
 33728	have in the navy. Uniform that does it. _(He turns gravely to the first
 33729	watch)_ Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in
 33730	some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. _(To the second watch
 33731	gaily)_ I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in the shake of
 33732	a lamb's tail.
 33733	
 33734	_(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)_
 33735	
 33736	THE DARK MERCURY: The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of
 33737	the army.
 33738	
 33739	MARTHA: _(Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of
 33740	the_ Irish Times _in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing)_ Henry!
 33741	Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.
 33742	
 33743	FIRST WATCH: _(Sternly)_ Come to the station.
 33744	
 33745	BLOOM: _(Scared, hats himself, steps back, then, plucking at his heart
 33746	and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and
 33747	dueguard of fellowcraft)_ No, no, worshipful master, light of love.
 33748	Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember
 33749	the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with
 33750	a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than
 33751	ninetynine wrongfully condemned.
 33752	
 33753	MARTHA: _(Sobbing behind her veil)_ Breach of promise. My real name
 33754	is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my
 33755	brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.
 33756	
 33757	BLOOM: _(Behind his hand)_ She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. _(He
 33758	murmurs vaguely the pass of Ephraim)_ Shitbroleeth.
 33759	
 33760	SECOND WATCH: _(Tears in his eyes, to Bloom)_ You ought to be thoroughly
 33761	well ashamed of yourself.
 33762	
 33763	BLOOM: Gentlemen of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am
 33764	a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable
 33765	married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street.
 33766	My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant
 33767	upstanding gentleman, what do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy,
 33768	one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his
 33769	majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.
 33770	
 33771	FIRST WATCH: Regiment.
 33772	
 33773	BLOOM: _(Turns to the gallery)_ The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the
 33774	earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms
 33775	up there among you. The R. D. F., with our own Metropolitan police,
 33776	guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men,
 33777	as physique, in the service of our sovereign.
 33778	
 33779	A VOICE: Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?
 33780	
 33781	BLOOM: _(His hand on the shoulder of the first watch)_ My old dad too
 33782	was a J. P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with
 33783	the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under general
 33784	Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was
 33785	mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. _(With quiet
 33786	feeling)_ Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.
 33787	
 33788	FIRST WATCH: Profession or trade.
 33789	
 33790	BLOOM: Well, I follow a literary occupation, author-journalist. In fact
 33791	we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the
 33792	inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected
 33793	with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...
 33794	
 33795	_(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His
 33796	scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles
 33797	a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a
 33798	telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)_
 33799	
 33800	MYLES CRAWFORD: _(His cock's wattles wagging)_ Hello, seventyseven
 33801	eightfour. Hello. _Freeman's Urinal_ and _Weekly Arsewipe_ here.
 33802	Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?
 33803	
 33804	_(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate
 33805	morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing,
 33806	creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He carries a large portfolio
 33807	labelled_ Matcham's Masterstrokes.)
 33808	
 33809	BEAUFOY: _(Drawls)_ No, you aren't. Not by a long shot if I know it.
 33810	I don't see it that's all. No born gentleman, no-one with the most
 33811	rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly
 33812	loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak
 33813	masquerading as a litterateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most
 33814	inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really
 33815	gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath
 33816	suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which
 33817	your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the
 33818	kingdom.
 33819	
 33820	BLOOM: _(Murmurs with hangdog meekness glum)_ That bit about the
 33821	laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may...
 33822	
 33823	BEAUFOY: _(His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court)_ You
 33824	funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't
 33825	think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard.
 33826	My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my
 33827	lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are
 33828	considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw
 33829	of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.
 33830	
 33831	BLOOM: _(Indistinctly)_ University of life. Bad art.
 33832	
 33833	BEAUFOY: _(Shouts)_ It's a damnably foul lie, showing the moral
 33834	rottenness of the man! _(He extends his portfolio)_ We have here damning
 33835	evidence, the _corpus delicti_, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work
 33836	disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.
 33837	
 33838	A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY:
 33839	
 33840	Moses, Moses, king of the jews, Wiped his arse in the Daily News.
 33841	
 33842	BLOOM: _(Bravely)_ Overdrawn.
 33843	
 33844	BEAUFOY: You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you
 33845	rotter! _(To the court)_ Why, look at the man's private life! Leading
 33846	a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be
 33847	mentioned in mixed society! The archconspirator of the age!
 33848	
 33849	BLOOM: _(To the court)_ And he, a bachelor, how...
 33850	
 33851	FIRST WATCH: The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.
 33852	
 33853	THE CRIER: Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!
 33854	
 33855	_(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket
 33856	on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)_
 33857	
 33858	SECOND WATCH: Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?
 33859	
 33860	MARY DRISCOLL: _(Indignantly)_ I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable
 33861	character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation,
 33862	six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave
 33863	owing to his carryings on.
 33864	
 33865	FIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?
 33866	
 33867	MARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself
 33868	as poor as I am.
 33869	
 33870	BLOOM: _(In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless
 33871	slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly)_ I treated you white.
 33872	I gave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station.
 33873	Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering.
 33874	There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.
 33875	
 33876	MARY DRISCOLL: _(Excitedly)_ As God is looking down on me this night if
 33877	ever I laid a hand to them oysters!
 33878	
 33879	FIRST WATCH: The offence complained of? Did something happen?
 33880	
 33881	MARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your honour,
 33882	when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety
 33883	pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he
 33884	interfered twict with my clothing.
 33885	
 33886	BLOOM: She counterassaulted.
 33887	
 33888	MARY DRISCOLL: _(Scornfully)_ I had more respect for the scouringbrush,
 33889	so I had. I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he remarked: keep it
 33890	quiet.
 33891	
 33892	_(General laughter.)_
 33893	
 33894	GEORGE FOTTRELL: _(Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly)_ Order in
 33895	court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.
 33896	
 33897	_(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins
 33898	a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in
 33899	his stirring address to the grand jury. He was down and out but, though
 33900	branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to
 33901	retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to
 33902	nature as a purely domestic animal. A sevenmonths' child, he had been
 33903	carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There
 33904	might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over
 33905	a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post,
 33906	to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the
 33907	affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An
 33908	acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate
 33909	of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain
 33910	refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of
 33911	loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly
 33912	rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one
 33913	and ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to
 33914	the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or
 33915	model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour
 33916	reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the
 33917	boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what
 33918	times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with
 33919	four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain
 33920	ever..._
 33921	
 33922	_(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that
 33923	they cannot hear.)_
 33924	
 33925	LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND: _(Without looking up from their notebooks)_
 33926	Loosen his boots.
 33927	
 33928	PROFESSOR MACHUGH: _(From the presstable, coughs and calls)_ Cough it
 33929	up, man. Get it out in bits.
 33930	
 33931	_(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A large bucket.
 33932	Bloom himself. Bowel trouble. In Beaver street Gripe, yes. Quite bad.
 33933	A plasterer's bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery.
 33934	Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial
 33935	moment. He did not look in the bucket Nobody. Rather a mess. Not
 33936	completely._ A Titbits _back number_.)

 33938	_(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash,
 33939	dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of stickingplaster across
 33940	his nose, talks inaudibly.)_
 33941	
 33942	J. J. O'MOLLOY: _(In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with
 33943	a voice of pained protest)_ This is no place for indecent levity at
 33944	the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a
 33945	beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My
 33946	client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as
 33947	a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up
 33948	misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on
 33949	by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence
 33950	being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the
 33951	Pharaoh. _Prima facie_, I put it to you that there was no attempt at
 33952	carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of
 33953	by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would
 33954	deal in especial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and
 33955	somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could
 33956	a tale unfold--one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between
 33957	the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from
 33958	cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian
 33959	extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.
 33960	
 33961	BLOOM: _(Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers,
 33962	apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about
 33963	him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches
 33964	his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes
 33965	the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.)_ Him makee velly muchee fine
 33966	night. _(He begins to lilt simply)_

 33974	J. J. O'MOLLOY: _(Hotly to the populace)_ This is a lonehand fight. By
 33975	Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this
 33976	fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has
 33977	superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically,
 33978	without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused
 33979	was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered
 33980	with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very
 33981	own daughter. _(Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his
 33982	lips.)_ I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the
 33983	hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My
 33984	client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to
 33985	do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or
 33986	cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard,
 33987	responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He
 33988	wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down
 33989	on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property
 33990	at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be
 33991	shown. _(To Bloom)_ I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.
 33992	
 33993	BLOOM: A penny in the pound.

 33996	silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino,
 33997	in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an
 33998	orange citron and a pork kidney.)_
 33999	
 34000	DLUGACZ: _(Hoarsely)_ Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W.13.
 34001	
 34002	_(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his
 34003	coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with
 34004	sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F.
 34005	Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the
 34006	galloping tide of rosepink blood.)_
 34007	
 34008	J.J.O'MOLLOY: _(Almost voicelessly)_ Excuse me. I am suffering from a
 34009	severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words.
 34010	_(He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of
 34011	Seymour Bushe.)_ When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught
 34012	that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of
 34013	soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar
 34014	the sacred benefit of the doubt. _(A paper with something written on it
 34015	is handed into court._)
 34016	
 34017	BLOOM: _(In court dress)_ Can give best references. Messrs Callan,
 34018	Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon,
 34019	ex lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the
 34020	highest... Queens of Dublin society. _(Carelessly)_ I was just chatting
 34021	this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and
 34022	lady Ball, astronomer royal at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...
 34023	
 34024	MRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength
 34025	ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brickquilted dolman, a comb of
 34026	brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair)_ Arrest him, constable. He
 34027	wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was
 34028	in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James
 34029	Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as
 34030	I sat in a box of the _Theatre Royal_ at a command performance of _La
 34031	Cigale_. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures
 34032	to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following
 34033	Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work
 34034	of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled _The Girl with the Three
 34035	Pairs of Stays_.
 34036	
 34037	MRS BELLINGHAM: _(In cap and seal coney mantle, wrapped up to the
 34038	nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell
 34039	quizzing-glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff)_
 34040	Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because
 34041	he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day
 34042	during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the
 34043	wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently
 34044	he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said,
 34045	in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the
 34046	information that it was ablossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined
 34047	from a forcingcase of the model farm.
 34048	
 34049	MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Shame on him!
 34050	
 34051	_(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins surges forward)_
 34052	
 34053	THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS: _(Screaming)_ Stop thief! Hurrah there,
 34054	Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!
 34055	
 34056	SECOND WATCH: _(Produces handcuffs)_ Here are the darbies.
 34057	
 34058	MRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome
 34059	compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my
 34060	frostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed himself
 34061	as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate
 34062	proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery
 34063	and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable,
 34064	a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether
 34065	extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and
 34066	eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which,
 34067	he said, he could conjure up. He urged me (stating that he felt it
 34068	his mission in life to urge me) to defile the marriage bed, to commit
 34069	adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.
 34070	
 34071	THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(In amazon costume, hard hat,
 34072	jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets
 34073	with braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she
 34074	strikes her welt constantly)_ Also me. Because he saw me on the polo
 34075	ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of
 34076	Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger
 34077	Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob
 34078	_Centaur._ This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car
 34079	and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold
 34080	after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still.
 34081	It represents a partially nude seÃ±orita, frail and lovely (his wife, as
 34082	he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit
 34083	intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me
 34084	to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He
 34085	implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise
 34086	him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most
 34087	vicious horsewhipping.
 34088	
 34089	MRS BELLINGHAM: Me too.
 34090	
 34091	MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Me too.
 34092	
 34093	_(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters
 34094	received from Bloom.)_
 34095	
 34096	THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Stamps her jingling spurs in a
 34097	sudden paroxysm of fury)_ I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the
 34098	pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.
 34099	
 34100	BLOOM: _(His eyes closing, quails expectantly)_ Here? _(He squirms)_
 34101	Again! _(He pants cringing)_ I love the danger.
 34102	
 34103	THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Very much so! I'll make it hot for
 34104	you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.
 34105	
 34106	MRS BELLINGHAM: Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and
 34107	stripes on it!
 34108	
 34109	MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married
 34110	man!
 34111	
 34112	BLOOM: All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling
 34113	glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.
 34114	
 34115	THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Laughs derisively)_ O, did you, my
 34116	fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your
 34117	life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained
 34118	for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.
 34119	
 34120	MRS BELLINGHAM: _(Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively)_
 34121	Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within
 34122	an inch of his life. The cat-o'-nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.
 34123	
 34124	BLOOM: _(Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands: with hangdog mien)_ O
 34125	cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet.
 34126	Let me off this once. _(He offers the other cheek)_
 34127	
 34128	MRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(Severely)_ Don't do so on any account, Mrs
 34129	Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!
 34130	
 34131	THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Unbuttoning her gauntlet
 34132	violently)_ I'll do no such thing. Pigdog and always was ever since
 34133	he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in
 34134	the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a
 34135	wellknown cuckold. _(She swishes her huntingcrop savagely in the air)_
 34136	Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick!
 34137	Ready?
 34138	
 34139	BLOOM: _(Trembling, beginning to obey)_ The weather has been so warm.

 34265	poor wife was awfully cut up. How is she bearing it? Keep her off that
 34266	bottle of sherry. _(He looks round him)_ A lamp. I must satisfy an
 34267	animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.

 34368	their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong
 34369	hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by
 34370	the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity nude, white,
 34371	still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth
 34372	roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes,

 34385	sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)_
 34386	
 34387	BLOOM: _(Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat
 34388	awkward hand)_ Are you a Dublin girl?
 34389	
 34390	ZOE: _(Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil)_ No bloody
 34391	fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?
 34392	
 34393	BLOOM: _(As before)_ Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish
 34394	device. _(Lewdly)_ The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder
 34395	of rank weed.
 34396

 34399	BLOOM: _(In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating
 34400	tie and apache cap)_ Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Ralegh brought
 34401	from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of
 34402	pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart,
 34403	memory, will understanding, all. That is to say he brought the poison
 34404	a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the
 34405	food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!

 34411	BLOOM: _(In alderman's gown and chain)_ Electors of Arran Quay, Inns
 34412	Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say,
 34413	from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future.
 34414	That's my programme. _Cui bono_? But our bucaneering Vanderdeckens in
 34415	their phantom ship of finance...
 34416	
 34417	AN ELECTOR: Three times three for our future chief magistrate!

 34425	thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and
 34426	white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens.
 34427	They nod vigorously in agreement.)_
 34428	
 34429	LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON: _(In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral
 34430	chain and large white silk scarf)_ That alderman sir Leo Bloom's speech
 34431	be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which
 34432	he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the
 34433	thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth
 34434	designated Boulevard Bloom.
 34435	
 34436	COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK: Carried unanimously.
 34437	
 34438	BLOOM: _(Impassionedly)_ These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as
 34439	they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they?
 34440	Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving
 34441	apparatuses, supplanters, bugbears, manufactured monsters for mutual
 34442	murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts
 34443	upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are
 34444	grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges
 34445	in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for
 34446	rever and ever and ev...
 34447	
 34448	_(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring
 34449	up. A streamer bearing the legends_ Cead Mile Failte _and_ Mah Ttob
 34450	Melek Israel _Spans the street. All the windows are thronged with
 34451	sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the
 34452	royal Dublin Fusiliers, the King's own Scottish Borderers, the Cameron
 34453	Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers standing to attention, keep back
 34454	the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts,
 34455	telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings,
 34456	rainspouts, whistling and cheering the pillar of the cloud appears. A
 34457	fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The
 34458	beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and
 34459	waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high,
 34460	surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession
 34461	appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard
 34462	tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are
 34463	followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of
 34464	Dublin, his lordship the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the
 34465	mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Waterford, twentyeight Irish
 34466	representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth
 34467	of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the
 34468	saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop
 34469	of Down and Connor, His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue, archbishop of
 34470	Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William

 34472	rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist,
 34473	methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society
 34474	of friends. After them march the guilds and trades and trainbands
 34475	with flying colours: coopers, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper
 34476	canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers,
 34477	chimneysweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers,

 34486	marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's
 34487	iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet.
 34488	Beefeaters reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph
 34489	Bloom appears, bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with
 34490	ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove,
 34491	the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite horse with long flowing crimson
 34492	tail, richly caparisoned, with golden headstall. Wild excitement. The
 34493	ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed
 34494	with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with
 34495	branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)_

 34522	
 34523	THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR: I here present your undoubted
 34524	emperor-president and king-chairman, the most serene and potent and very
 34525	puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!

 34532	WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH: _(In purple stock and shovel hat)_
 34533	Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your
 34534	judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?
 34535

 34582	BLOOM: On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at
 34583	Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with
 34584	telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do
 34585	we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the
 34586	left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering

 34602	ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem

 34608	huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its
 34609	extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government
 34610	offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses

 34789	MOTHER GROGAN: _(Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom)_ You beast! You
 34790	abominable person!

 34792	NOSEY FLYNN: Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.
 34793	
 34794	BLOOM: _(With rollicking humour)_
 34795	
 34796	     I vowed that I never would leave her,

 34809	THE VEILED SIBYL: _(Enthusiastically)_ I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it.
 34810	I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest
 34811	man on earth.

 34822	their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from
 34823	the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery,
 34824	asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gasovens, hanging
 34825	themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different
 34826	storeys.)_
 34827	
 34828	ALEXANDER J DOWIE: _(Violently)_ Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the
 34829	man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian
 34830	men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat
 34831	of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery, recalling the
 34832	cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite,
 34833	bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse.
 34834	A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his
 34835	nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him.
 34836	Caliban!

 34838	THE MOB: Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!
 34839	
 34840	_(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper
 34841	and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value,
 34842	hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheep's
 34843	tails, odd pieces of fat.)_
 34844	
 34845	BLOOM: _(Excitedly)_ This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again.
 34846	By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry.
 34847	He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the
 34848	viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, _sgenl inn ban bata
 34849	coisde gan capall._ I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex
 34850	specialist, to give medical testimony on my behalf.
 34851	
 34852	DR MULLIGAN: _(In motor jerkin, green motorgoggles on his brow)_ Dr
 34853	Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's
 34854	private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary
 34855	epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of
 34856	elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are
 34857	marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also
 34858	latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in
 34859	consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a
 34860	family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him
 34861	to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal
 34862	examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal,
 34863	axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be _virgo intacta._
 34864	
 34865	_(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)_
 34866	
 34867	DR MADDEN: Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming
 34868	generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in
 34869	spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.
 34870	
 34871	DR CROTTHERS: I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid.
 34872	Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.
 34873	
 34874	DR PUNCH COSTELLO: The _fetor judaicus_ is most perceptible.
 34875	
 34876	DR DIXON: _(Reads a bill of health)_ Professor Bloom is a finished
 34877	example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable.
 34878	Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint
 34879	fellow on the whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense.
 34880	He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court
 34881	missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up
 34882	everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that
 34883	he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried
 34884	grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish manufacture winter and
 34885	summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one
 34886	time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report
 34887	states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the
 34888	name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon
 34889	to speak. He is about to have a baby.
 34890	
 34891	_(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American
 34892	makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, blank
 34893	cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange,
 34894	I. O. U's, wedding rings, watchchains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets
 34895	are rapidly collected.)_
 34896	
 34897	BLOOM: O, I so want to be a mother.
 34898	
 34899	MRS THORNTON: _(In nursetender's gown)_ Embrace me tight, dear. You'll
 34900	be soon over it. Tight, dear.
 34901	
 34902	_(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white
 34903	children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive
 34904	plants. All the octuplets are handsome, with valuable metallic faces,
 34905	wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern
 34906	languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each
 34907	has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro,
 34908	Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindoree, Silversmile, Silberselber,
 34909	Vifargent, Panargyros. They are immediately appointed to positions of
 34910	high public trust in several different countries as managing directors
 34911	of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability

 35077	short time? Ten shillings?

 35111	lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)_

 35130	her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the antlered rack of the hall
 35131	hang a man 's hat and waterproof. Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing
 35132	them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is
 35133	flung open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes
 35134	with an ape's gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a
 35135	full waterjugjar, his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting
 35136	his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel
 35137	eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe
 35138	into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the
 35139	chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The
 35140	floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar
 35141	rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel,
 35142	heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet
 35143	without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls
 35144	are tapestried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate
 35145	is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on
 35146	the hearthrug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he
 35147	beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume,
 35148	doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in
 35149	her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and
 35150	glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag
 35151	of her corsetlace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates

 35156	white petticoat with his wand she settles them down quickly.)_ Respect
 35157	yourself. _(She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which
 35158	her hair glows, red with henna)_ O, excuse!
 35159	
 35160	ZOE: More limelight, Charley. _(She goes to the chandelier and turns the
 35161	gas full cock)_
 35162

 35164	
 35165	LYNCH: _(Deeply)_ Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

 35167	ZOE: Clap on the back for Zoe.

 35184	
 35185	STEPHEN: As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto
 35186	Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an
 35187	old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate _Coela enarrant gloriam Domini._
 35188	It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and
 35189	mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's
 35190	that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip
 35191	from the stable to his chief bassoonist about the alrightness of his
 35192	almightiness. _Mais nom de nom,_ that is another pair of trousers.
 35193	_Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at
 35194	Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs)_ Which side is your knowledge bump?

 35197	reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form
 35198	of life. Bah!
 35199	
 35200	STEPHEN: You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes.
 35201	How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!
 35202	
 35203	THE CAP: Bah!
 35204	
 35205	STEPHEN: Here's another for you. _(He frowns)_ The reason is because
 35206	the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible
 35207	interval which...
 35208	
 35209	THE CAP: Which? Finish. You can't.

 35211	STEPHEN: _(With an effort)_ Interval which. Is the greatest possible
 35212	ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.

 35214	THE CAP: Which?
 35215	
 35216	_(Outside the gramophone begins to blare_ The Holy City.)
 35217	
 35218	STEPHEN: _(Abruptly)_ What went forth to the ends of the world to
 35219	traverse not itself, God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller,
 35220	having itself traversed in reality itself becomes that self. Wait a
 35221	moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self
 35222	which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. _Ecco!_

 35225	Higgins)_ What a learned speech, eh?

 35228	forgotten.

 35433	_(He coughs thoughtfully, drily)_ Promiscuous nakedness is much in
 35434	evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact
 35435	that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you
 35436	are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you
 35437	perceived? Good.
 35438	
 35439	BLOOM: Granpapachi. But...
 35440	
 35441	VIRAG: Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and
 35442	coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of
 35443	gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I
 35444	should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always
 35445	understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of
 35446	lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a
 35447	word. Hippogriff. Am I right?
 35448	
 35449	BLOOM: She is rather lean.
 35450	
 35451	VIRAG: _(Not unpleasantly)_ Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier
 35452	pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest
 35453	bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull
 35454	has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the
 35455	attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you
 35456	can wear today. Parallax! _(With a nervous twitch of his head)_ Did you
 35457	hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!
 35458	
 35459	BLOOM: _(An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek)_
 35460	She seems sad.
 35461	
 35462	VIRAG: _(Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left
 35463	eye with a finger and barks hoarsely)_ Hoax! Beware of the flapper
 35464	and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button
 35465	discovered by Rualdus Columbus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon.
 35466	_(More genially)_ Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item
 35467	number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe
 35468	the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she
 35469	bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.
 35470	
 35471	BLOOM: _(Regretfully)_ When you come out without your gun.
 35472	
 35473	VIRAG: We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your
 35474	money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...
 35475	
 35476	BLOOM: With...?
 35477	
 35478	VIRAG: _(His tongue upcurling)_ Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She
 35479	is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in
 35480	weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two
 35481	protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the
 35482	noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional
 35483	protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation,
 35484	which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts
 35485	are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers
 35486	reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and
 35487	gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their
 35488	brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That
 35489	suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in
 35490	it. Lycopodium. _(His throat twitches)_ Slapbang! There he goes again.
 35491	
 35492	BLOOM: The stye I dislike.
 35493	
 35494	VIRAG: _(Arches his eyebrows)_ Contact with a goldring, they say.
 35495	_Argumentum ad feminam_, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece
 35496	in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyosauros. For the rest Eve's
 35497	sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. _(He twitches)_ It
 35498	is a funny sound. _(He coughs encouragingly)_ But possibly it is only a
 35499	wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on
 35500	that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.
 35501	
 35502	BLOOM: _(Reflecting)_ Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This
 35503	searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of
 35504	accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said...
 35505	
 35506	VIRAG: _(Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking)_ Stop
 35507	twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten.
 35508	Exercise your mnemotechnic. _La causa Ã¨ santa_. Tara. Tara. _(Aside)_ He
 35509	will surely remember.
 35510	
 35511	BLOOM: Rosemary also did I understand you to say or willpower over
 35512	parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a
 35513	deadhand cures. Mnemo?
 35514	
 35515	VIRAG: _(Excitedly)_ I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. _(He taps his
 35516	parchmentroll energetically)_ This book tells you how to act with all
 35517	descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite,
 35518	melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about
 35519	amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with
 35520	horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar
 35521	and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike
 35522	women in male habiliments? _(With a dry snigger)_ You intended to devote
 35523	an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer
 35524	months of 1886 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate!
 35525	From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say?
 35526	Or stockingette gussetted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case,
 35527	those complicated combinations, camiknickers? _(He crows derisively)_
 35528	Keekeereekee!

 35535	will then morrow as now was be past yester.

 35537	VIRAG: _(Prompts in a pig's whisper)_ Insects of the day spend their
 35538	brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the
 35539	inferiorly pulchritudinous fumale possessing extendified pudendal nerve
 35540	in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! _(His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally)_
 35541	They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand

 35545	we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. _(He coughs and, bending
 35546	his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand)_ You shall
 35547	find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember
 35548	their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the
 35549	seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion
 35550	which Doctor L.B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to
 35551	example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That

 35561	we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! _(He unrolls his parchment rapidly and
 35562	reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he
 35563	claws)_ Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer. Redbank oysters will
 35564	shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may
 35565	help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister
 35566	omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or
 35567	viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. _(He wags his head with
 35568	cackling raillery)_ Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular. _(He
 35569	sneezes)_ Amen!

 35572	sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve
 35573	and the serpent contradicts. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy
 35574	to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way
 35575	through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like
 35576	those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.

 35681	am the Virag who disclosed the Sex Secrets of Monks and Maidens. Why
 35682	I left the church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the

 35922	BLOOM: _(Looks down with a sheepish grin)_ That is so.
 35923	
 35924	THE FAN: _(Folding together, rests against her left eardrop)_ Have you
 35925	forgotten me?
 35926	
 35927	BLOOM: Yes. Yo.
 35928	
 35929	THE FAN: _(Folded akimbo against her waist)_ Is me her was you dreamed
 35930	before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now
 35931	we?
 35932	
 35933	_(Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)_
 35934	
 35935	BLOOM: _(Wincing)_ Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which
 35936	women love.
 35937	
 35938	THE FAN: _(Tapping)_ We have met. You are mine. It is fate.
 35939	
 35940	BLOOM: _(Cowed)_ Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your
 35941	domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to
 35942	speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before
 35943	the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door
 35944	and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per
 35945	second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant
 35946	a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family.
 35947	Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed
 35948	in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the
 35949	end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with
 35950	Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle as you probably... _(He
 35951	winces)_ Ah!
 35952	
 35953	RICHIE GOULDING: _(Bagweighted, passes the door)_ Mocking is catch. Best
 35954	value in Dub. Fit for a prince's. Liver and kidney.
 35955	
 35956	THE FAN: _(Tapping)_ All things end. Be mine. Now.
 35957	
 35958	BLOOM: _(Undecided)_ All now? I should not have parted with my talisman.
 35959	Rain, exposure at dewfall on the searocks, a peccadillo at my time of
 35960	life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.
 35961	
 35962	THE FAN: _(Points downwards slowly)_ You may.
 35963	
 35964	BLOOM: _(Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace)_ We are
 35965	observed.
 35966	
 35967	THE FAN: _(Points downwards quickly)_ You must.
 35968	
 35969	BLOOM: _(With desire, with reluctance)_ I can make a true black knot.
 35970	Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for
 35971	Kellett's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy.
 35972	I knelt once before today. Ah!
 35973	
 35974	_(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the
 35975	edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked.
 35976	Bloom, stifflegged, aging, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers
 35977	draws out and in her laces.)_
 35978	
 35979	BLOOM: _(Murmurs lovingly)_ To be a shoefitter in Manfield's was my
 35980	love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace
 35981	up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so
 35982	incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model
 35983	Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb
 35984	toe, as worn in Paris.
 35985	
 35986	THE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.
 35987	
 35988	BLOOM: _(Crosslacing)_ Too tight?
 35989	
 35990	THE HOOF: If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.
 35991	
 35992	BLOOM: Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar
 35993	dance. Bad luck. Hook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned.
 35994	That night she met... Now!
 35995	
 35996	_(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises
 35997	his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in midbrow. His eyes grow
 35998	dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)_
 35999	
 36000	BLOOM: _(Mumbles)_ Awaiting your further orders we remain, gentlemen,...
 36001	
 36002	BELLO: _(With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice)_ Hound of
 36003	dishonour!
 36004	
 36005	BLOOM: _(Infatuated)_ Empress!
 36006	
 36007	BELLO: _(His heavy cheekchops sagging)_ Adorer of the adulterous rump!
 36008	
 36009	BLOOM: _(Plaintively)_ Hugeness!
 36010	
 36011	BELLO: Dungdevourer!
 36012	
 36013	BLOOM: _(With sinews semiflexed)_ Magmagnificence!
 36014	
 36015	BELLO: Down! _(He taps her on the shoulder with his fan)_ Incline feet
 36016	forward! Slide left foot one pace back! You will fall. You are falling.
 36017	On the hands down!
 36018	
 36019	BLOOM: _(Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing, yaps)_
 36020	Truffles!
 36021	
 36022	_(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting,
 36023	snuffling, rooting at his feet: then lies, shamming dead, with eyes shut
 36024	tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most
 36025	excellent master.)_
 36026	
 36027	BELLO: _(With bobbed hair, purple gills, fit moustache rings round his
 36028	shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport
 36029	skirt and alpine hat with moorcock's feather, his hands stuck deep in
 36030	his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in)_
 36031	Footstool! Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of
 36032	your despot's glorious heels so glistening in their proud erectness.
 36033	
 36034	BLOOM: _(Enthralled, bleats)_ I promise never to disobey.
 36035	
 36036	BELLO: _(Laughs loudly)_ Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for
 36037	you. I'm the Tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet
 36038	Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me,
 36039	I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be
 36040	inflicted in gym costume.
 36041	
 36042	_(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.)_
 36043	
 36044	ZOE: _(Widening her slip to screen her)_ She's not here.
 36045	
 36046	BLOOM: _(Closing her eyes)_ She's not here.
 36047	
 36048	FLORRY: _(Hiding her with her gown)_ She didn't mean it, Mr Bello.
 36049	She'll be good, sir.
 36050	
 36051	KITTY: Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.
 36052	
 36053	BELLO: _(Coaxingly)_ Come, ducky dear, I want a word with you, darling,
 36054	just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk,
 36055	sweety. _(Bloom puts out her timid head)_ There's a good girly now.
 36056	_(Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward)_ I only want
 36057	to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender
 36058	behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.
 36059	
 36060	BLOOM: _(Fainting)_ Don't tear my...
 36061	
 36062	BELLO: _(Savagely)_ The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging
 36063	hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian
 36064	slave of old. You're in for it this time! I'll make you remember me for
 36065	the balance of your natural life. _(His forehead veins swollen, his face
 36066	congested)_ I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after
 36067	my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat hamrashers and a bottle
 36068	of Guinness's porter. _(He belches)_ And suck my thumping good Stock
 36069	Exchange cigar while I read the _Licensed Victualler's Gazette_. Very
 36070	possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and
 36071	enjoy a slice of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted
 36072	and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will
 36073	hurt you. _(He twists her arm. Bloom squeals, turning turtle.)_
 36074	
 36075	BLOOM: Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!
 36076	
 36077	BELLO: _(Twisting)_ Another!
 36078	
 36079	BLOOM: _(Screams)_ O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches
 36080	like mad!
 36081	
 36082	BELLO: _(Shouts)_ Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best
 36083	bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn
 36084	you! _(He slaps her face)_
 36085	
 36086	BLOOM: _(Whimpers)_ You're after hitting me. I'll tell...
 36087	
 36088	BELLO: Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.
 36089	
 36090	ZOE: Yes. Walk on him! I will.
 36091	
 36092	FLORRY: I will. Don't be greedy.
 36093	
 36094	KITTY: No, me. Lend him to me.
 36095	
 36096	_(The brothel cook, mrs keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib,
 36097	men's grey and green socks and brogues, floursmeared, a rollingpin stuck
 36098	with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)_
 36099	
 36100	MRS KEOGH: _(Ferociously)_ Can I help? _(They hold and pinion Bloom.)_
 36101	
 36102	BELLO: _(Squats with a grunt on Bloom's upturned face, puffing
 36103	cigarsmoke, nursing a fat leg)_ I see Keating Clay is elected
 36104	vicechairman of the Richmond asylum and by the by Guinness's preference
 36105	shares are at sixteen three quaffers. Curse me for a fool that didn't
 36106	buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck,
 36107	curse it. And that Goddamned outsider _Throwaway_ at twenty to one.
 36108	_(He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear)_ Where's that Goddamned
 36109	cursed ashtray?
 36110	
 36111	BLOOM: _(Goaded, buttocksmothered)_ O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!
 36112	
 36113	BELLO: Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg. Pray for it as you never
 36114	prayed before. _(He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar)_ Here,
 36115	kiss that. Both. Kiss. _(He throws a leg astride and, pressing with
 36116	horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice)_ Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury
 36117	cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. _(He bends sideways and
 36118	squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting)_ Ho! Off we pop! I'll
 36119	nurse you in proper fashion. _(He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the
 36120	saddle)_ The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot
 36121	and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.
 36122	
 36123	FLORRY: _(Pulls at Bello)_ Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked
 36124	before you.
 36125	
 36126	ZOE: _(Pulling at florry)_ Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet,
 36127	suckeress?
 36128	
 36129	BLOOM: _(Stifling)_ Can't.
 36130	
 36131	BELLO: Well, I'm not. Wait. _(He holds in his breath)_ Curse it. Here.
 36132	This bung's about burst. _(He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting
 36133	his features, farts loudly)_ Take that! _(He recorks himself)_ Yes, by
 36134	Jingo, sixteen three quarters.
 36135	
 36136	BLOOM: _(A sweat breaking out over him)_ Not man. _(He sniffs)_ Woman.
 36137	
 36138	BELLO: _(Stands up)_ No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has
 36139	come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing
 36140	under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male
 36141	garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously
 36142	rustling over head and shoulders. And quickly too!
 36143	
 36144	BLOOM: _(Shrinks)_ Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I
 36145	tiptouch it with my nails?
 36146	
 36147	BELLO: _(Points to his whores)_ As they are now so will you be, wigged,
 36148	singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape
 36149	measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel
 36150	force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with whalebone busk to
 36151	the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure,
 36152	plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks,
 36153	pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course,
 36154	with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice
 36155	scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be
 36156	a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly
 36157	flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...
 36158	
 36159	BLOOM: _(A charming soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and large
 36160	male hands and nose, leering mouth)_ I tried her things on only twice,
 36161	a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hard up I washed them to
 36162	save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.
 36163	
 36164	BELLO: _(Jeers)_ Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh? And showed
 36165	off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind closedrawn blinds
 36166	your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders in various poses of surrender,
 36167	eh? Ho! ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and
 36168	short trunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that
 36169	Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel, eh?
 36170	
 36171	BLOOM: Miriam. Black. Demimondaine.
 36172	
 36173	BELLO: _(Guffaws)_ Christ Almighty it's too tickling, this! You were
 36174	a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and
 36175	lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade about to be
 36176	violated by lieutenant Smythe-Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell M.
 36177	P., signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy,
 36178	Henri Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Croesus, the
 36179	varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland
 36180	and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. _(He guffaws again)_ Christ,
 36181	wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?
 36182	
 36183	BLOOM: _(Her hands and features working)_ It was Gerald converted me to
 36184	be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School
 36185	play _Vice Versa_. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by
 36186	sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his
 36187	eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.
 36188	
 36189	BELLO: _(With wicked glee)_ Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you
 36190	took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the
 36191	smoothworn throne.
 36192	
 36193	BLOOM: Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. _(Earnestly)_
 36194	And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet...
 36195	
 36196	BELLO: _(Sternly)_ No insubordination! The sawdust is there in the
 36197	corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it
 36198	standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a
 36199	trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a
 36200	martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.
 36201	
 36202	THE SINS OF THE PAST: _(In a medley of voices)_ He went through a form
 36203	of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the
 36204	Black church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn
 36205	at an address in D'Olier street while he presented himself indecently to
 36206	the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he frankly encouraged
 36207	a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary
 36208	outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences
 36209	he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all
 36210	strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did
 36211	he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and
 36212	what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar,
 36213	gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to
 36214	him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?
 36215	
 36216	BELLO: _(Whistles loudly)_ Say! What was the most revolting piece of
 36217	obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out! Be
 36218	candid for once.
 36219

 36229	Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good ghoststory or a
 36230	line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how
 36231	many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr...

 36236	when you're spoken to.
 36237	
 36238	BLOOM: _(Bows)_ Master! Mistress! Mantamer!
 36239	
 36240	_(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fill.)_
 36241	
 36242	BELLO: _(Satirically)_ By day you will souse and bat our smelling
 36243	underclothes also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines
 36244	with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be
 36245	nice? _(He places a ruby ring on her finger)_ And there now! With this
 36246	ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.
 36247	
 36248	BLOOM: Thank you, mistress.
 36249	
 36250	BELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in
 36251	the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one.
 36252	Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne.
 36253	Drink me piping hot. Hop! You will dance attendance or I'll lecture you
 36254	on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss,
 36255	with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night
 36256	your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves
 36257	newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such
 36258	favours knights of old laid down their lives. _(He chuckles)_ My boys
 36259	will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above
 36260	all, when they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new
 36261	attraction in gilded heels. First I'll have a go at you myself. A man I
 36262	know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just
 36263	now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is
 36264	on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust.
 36265	Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? _(He points)_ For that lot. Trained
 36266	by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. _(He bares his arm and
 36267	plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva)_ There's fine depth for you!
 36268	What, boys? That give you a hardon? _(He shoves his arm in a bidder's
 36269	face)_ Here wet the deck and wipe it round!
 36270	
 36271	A BIDDER: A florin.

 36278	
 36279	CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH: Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.
 36280	
 36281	BELLO: _(Gives a rap with his gavel)_ Two bar. Rockbottom figure and
 36282	cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points.
 36283	Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If
 36284	I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid
 36285	gallons a day. A pure stockgetter, due to lay within the hour. His
 36286	sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks.
 36287	Whoa my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! _(He brands his initial C on Bloom's
 36288	croup)_ So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?
 36289	
 36290	A DARKVISAGED MAN: _(In disguised accent)_ Hoondert punt sterlink.
 36291	
 36292	VOICES: _(Subdued)_ For the Caliph. Haroun Al Raschid.
 36293	
 36294	BELLO: _(Gaily)_ Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short
 36295	skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a
 36296	potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the
 36297	long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better
 36298	instincts of the _blasÃ©_ man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk
 36299	on four inch Louis Quinze heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup,
 36300	the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your powers of
 36301	fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.

 36303	BLOOM: _(Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with
 36304	forefinger in mouth)_ O, I know what you're hinting at now!
 36305	
 36306	BELLO: What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? _(He
 36307	stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suet folds
 36308	of Bloom's haunches)_ Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your
 36309	curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy,
 36310	sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy
 36311	a bucket or sell your pump. _(Loudly)_ Can you do a man's job?
 36312	
 36313	BLOOM: Eccles street...
 36314	
 36315	BELLO: _(Sarcastically)_ I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but
 36316	there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my
 36317	gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for
 36318	you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all
 36319	over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee,
 36320	belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he
 36321	has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months,
 36322	my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts
 36323	already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? _(He spits in
 36324	contempt)_ Spittoon!
 36325	
 36326	BLOOM: I was indecently treated, I... Inform the police. Hundred
 36327	pounds. Unmentionable. I...
 36328	
 36329	BELLO: Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want not your
 36330	drizzle.
 36331	
 36332	BLOOM: To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll... We... Still...
 36333	
 36334	BELLO: _(Ruthlessly)_ No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will
 36335	since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years.
 36336	Return and see.
 36337	
 36338	_(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)_
 36339	
 36340	SLEEPY HOLLOW: Rip van Wink! Rip van Winkle!
 36341	
 36342	BLOOM: _(In tattered mocassins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tiptoeing,
 36343	fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond
 36344	panes, cries out)_ I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's!
 36345	But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he...
 36346	
 36347	BELLO: _(Laughs mockingly)_ That's your daughter, you owl, with a
 36348	Mullingar student.
 36349	
 36350	_(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her blue scarf
 36351	in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and
 36352	calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)_
 36353	
 36354	MILLY: My! It's Papli! But, O Papli, how old you've grown!
 36355	
 36356	BELLO: Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writingtable where we never wrote,
 36357	aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and
 36358	his menfriends are living there in clover. The _Cuckoos' Rest!_ Why not?
 36359	How many women had you, eh, following them up dark streets, flatfoot,
 36360	exciting them by your smothered grunts, what, you male prostitute?
 36361	Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the
 36362	goose, my gander O.
 36363	
 36364	BLOOM: They... I...
 36365	
 36366	BELLO: _(Cuttingly)_ Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet
 36367	you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to
 36368	find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue
 36369	you carried home in the rain for art for art' sake. They will violate
 36370	the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook
 36371	of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten
 36372	shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.
 36373	
 36374	BLOOM: Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return.
 36375	I will prove...
 36376	
 36377	A VOICE: Swear!
 36378	
 36379	_(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowieknife between his
 36380	teeth.)_
 36381	
 36382	BELLO: As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your
 36383	secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You
 36384	are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.
 36385	
 36386	BLOOM: Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody...? _(He bites his
 36387	thumb)_
 36388	
 36389	BELLO: Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency
 36390	or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you
 36391	skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have!
 36392	If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury
 36393	you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck
 36394	Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and
 36395	sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands,
 36396	whatever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cesspool. _(He
 36397	explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh)_ We'll manure you, Mr Flower! _(He
 36398	pipes scoffingly)_ Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!
 36399	
 36400	BLOOM: _(Clasps his head)_ My willpower! Memory! I have sinned! I have
 36401	suff...
 36402	
 36403	_(He weeps tearlessly)_
 36404	
 36405	BELLO: _(Sneers)_ Crybabby! Crocodile tears!
 36406	
 36407	_(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to
 36408	the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the
 36409	circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M.
 36410	Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater, Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M.
 36411	Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, P. Mastiansky, The Reverend Leopold
 36412	Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the
 36413	recreant Bloom.)_
 36414	
 36415	THE CIRCUMCISED: _(In dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit
 36416	upon him, no flowers) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad._
 36417	
 36418	VOICES: _(Sighing)_ So he's gone. Ah yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never
 36419	heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah,
 36420	yes.
 36421	
 36422	_(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of
 36423	incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oakframe a nymph with
 36424	hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown artcolours, descends from her
 36425	grotto and passing under interlacing yews stands over Bloom.)_
 36426	
 36427	THE YEWS: _(Their leaves whispering)_ Sister. Our sister. Ssh!
 36428	
 36429	THE NYMPH: _(Softly)_ Mortal! _(Kindly)_ Nay, dost not weepest!
 36430	
 36431	BLOOM: _(Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight,
 36432	with dignity)_ This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of
 36433	habit.
 36434	
 36435	THE NYMPH: Mortal! You found me in evil company, highkickers, coster
 36436	picnicmakers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in
 36437	fleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical
 36438	act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt
 36439	of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to
 36440	disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads,
 36441	proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured
 36442	gentleman. Useful hints to the married.
 36443	
 36444	BLOOM: _(Lifts a turtle head towards her lap)_ We have met before. On
 36445	another star.
 36446	
 36447	THE NYMPH: _(Sadly)_ Rubber goods. Neverrip brand as supplied to the
 36448	aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited
 36449	testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust
 36450	developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.
 36451	
 36452	BLOOM: You mean _Photo Bits?_
 36453	
 36454	THE NYMPH: I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me
 36455	above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in
 36456	four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my
 36457	shame.
 36458	
 36459	BLOOM: _(Humbly kisses her long hair)_ Your classic curves, beautiful
 36460	immortal, I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty,
 36461	almost to pray.
 36462	
 36463	THE NYMPH: During dark nights I heard your praise.
 36464	
 36465	BLOOM: _(Quickly)_ Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst
 36466	side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of bed
 36467	or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest
 36468	there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days
 36469	ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless, inoffensive
 36470	vent. _(He sighs)_ 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.
 36471	
 36472	THE NYMPH: _(Her fingers in her ears)_ And words. They are not in my
 36473	dictionary.
 36474	
 36475	BLOOM: You understood them?
 36476	
 36477	THE YEWS: Ssh!
 36478	
 36479	THE NYMPH: _(Covers her face with her hands)_ What have I not seen in
 36480	that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?
 36481	
 36482	BLOOM: _(Apologetically)_ I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up
 36483	with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea long ago.
 36484	
 36485	THE NYMPH: _(Bends her head)_ Worse, worse!
 36486	
 36487	BLOOM: _(Reflects precautiously)_ That antiquated commode. It wasn't her
 36488	weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds
 36489	after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd
 36490	orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.
 36491	
 36492	_(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)_
 36493	
 36494	THE WATERFALL:
 36495	
 36496	     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
 36497	     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.
 36498	
 36499	THE YEWS: _(Mingling their boughs)_ Listen. Whisper. She is right, our
 36500	sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous
 36501	summer days.
 36502	
 36503	
 36504	JOHN WYSE NOLAN: _(In the background, in Irish National Forester's
 36505	uniform, doffs his plumed hat)_ Prosper! Give shade on languorous days,
 36506	trees of Ireland!
 36507	
 36508	THE YEWS: _(Murmuring)_ Who came to Poulaphouca with the High School
 36509	excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?
 36510	
 36511	BLOOM: _(Scared)_ High School of Poula? Mnemo? Not in full possession of
 36512	faculties. Concussion. Run over by tram.
 36513	
 36514	THE ECHO: Sham!
 36515	
 36516	BLOOM: _(Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript
 36517	juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis
 36518	shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops and a red schoolcap with
 36519	badge)_ I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a
 36520	jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory,
 36521	the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs (for they love crushes,
 36522	instinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles
 36523	vice), even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were
 36524	sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.
 36525	
 36526	_(Halcyon days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and
 36527	shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen
 36528	Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing
 36529	of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)_
 36530	
 36531	THE HALCYON DAYS: Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray! _(They cheer)_
 36532	
 36533	BLOOM: _(Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, starred with spent
 36534	snowballs, struggles to rise)_ Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's
 36535	ring all the bells in Montague street. _(He cheers feebly)_ Hurray for
 36536	the High School!
 36537	
 36538	THE ECHO: Fool!
 36539	
 36540	THE YEWS: _(Rustling)_ She is right, our sister. Whisper. _(Whispered
 36541	kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from
 36542	the boles and among the leaves and break, blossoming into bloom.)_ Who
 36543	profaned our silent shade?
 36544	
 36545	THE NYMPH: _(Coyly, through parting fingers)_ There? In the open air?
 36546	
 36547	THE YEWS: _(Sweeping downward)_ Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.
 36548	
 36549	THE WATERFALL:
 36550	
 36551	     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
 36552	     Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.
 36553	
 36554	THE NYMPH: _(With wide fingers)_ O, infamy!
 36555	
 36556	BLOOM: I was precocious. Youth. The fauna. I sacrificed to the god of
 36557	the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing
 36558	time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke,
 36559	flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through illclosed curtains
 36560	with poor papa's operaglasses: The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled
 36561	downhill at Rialto bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits.
 36562	She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The
 36563	demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?
 36564	
 36565	_(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf, thrusts a ruminating head with
 36566	humid nostrils through the foliage.)_
 36567	
 36568	STAGGERING BOB: (LARGE TEARDROPS ROLLING FROM HIS PROMINENT EYES,
 36569	SNIVELS) Me. Me see.
 36570	
 36571	BLOOM: Simply satisfying a need I... _(With pathos)_ No girl would when
 36572	I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play...
 36573	
 36574	_(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes,
 36575	plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping currants.)_
 36576	
 36577	THE NANNYGOAT: _(Bleats)_ Megeggaggegg! Nannannanny!
 36578	
 36579	BLOOM: _(Hatless, flushed, covered with burrs of thistledown and
 36580	gorsespine)_ Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. _(He gazes
 36581	intently downwards on the water)_ Thirtytwo head over heels per second.
 36582	Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government
 36583	printer's clerk. _(Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom,
 36584	rolled in a mummy, rolls roteatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the
 36585	purple waiting waters.)_
 36586	
 36587	THE DUMMYMUMMY: Bbbbblllllblblblblobschbg!
 36588	
 36589	_(Far out in the bay between bailey and kish lights the_ Erin's King
 36590	_sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards
 36591	the land.)_
 36592	
 36593	COUNCILLOR NANNETII: _(Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellowkitefaced,
 36594	his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims)_ When my country takes her
 36595	place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then, let my
 36596	epitaph be written. I have...
 36597	
 36598	BLOOM: Done. Prff!
 36599	
 36600	THE NYMPH: _(Loftily)_ We immortals, as you saw today, have not such
 36601	a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat
 36602	electric light. _(She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing
 36603	her forefinger in her mouth)_ Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then
 36604	could you...?
 36605	
 36606	BLOOM: _(Pawing the heather abjectly)_ O, I have been a perfect pig.
 36607	Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia to which
 36608	add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's
 36609	syringe, the ladies' friend.
 36610	
 36611	THE NYMPH: In my presence. The powderpuff. _(She blushes and makes a
 36612	knee)_ And the rest!
 36613	
 36614	BLOOM: _(Dejected)_ Yes. _Peccavi!_ I have paid homage on that living
 36615	altar where the back changes name. _(With sudden fervour)_ For why
 36616	should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules...?
 36617	
 36618	_(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems,
 36619	cooeeing)_
 36620	
 36621	THE VOICE OF KITTY: _(In the thicket)_ Show us one of them cushions.
 36622	
 36623	THE VOICE OF FLORRY: Here.
 36624	
 36625	_(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)_
 36626	
 36627	THE VOICE OF LYNCH: _(In the thicket)_ Whew! Piping hot!
 36628	
 36629	THE VOICE OF ZOE: _(From the thicket)_ Came from a hot place.
 36630	
 36631	THE VOICE OF VIRAG: _(A birdchief, bluestreaked and feathered in war
 36632	panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over
 36633	beechmast and acorns)_ Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!
 36634	
 36635	BLOOM: It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit
 36636	where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to
 36637	grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted
 36638	white sateen coatpans. So womanly, full. It fills me full.
 36639	
 36640	THE WATERFALL:
 36641	
 36642	     _Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
 36643	     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca._
 36644	
 36645	THE YEWS: Ssh! Sister, speak!
 36646	
 36647	THE NYMPH: _(Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and hugewinged wimple,
 36648	softly, with remote eyes)_ Tranquilla convent. Sister Agatha. Mount
 36649	Carmel. The apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. _(She
 36650	reclines her head, sighing)_ Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull
 36651	waves o'er the waters dull.
 36652	
 36653	_(Bloom half rises. His back trouserbutton snaps.)_
 36654	
 36655	THE BUTTON: Bip!
 36656	
 36657	_(Two sluts of the coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)_
 36658	
 36659	THE SLUTS:
 36660	
 36661	     O, Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
 36662	     He didn't know what to do,
 36663	     To keep it up,
 36664	     To keep it up.
 36665	
 36666	BLOOM: _(Coldly)_ You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there
 36667	were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy
 36668	but willing like an ass pissing.
 36669	
 36670	THE YEWS: _(Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms
 36671	aging and swaying)_ Deciduously!
 36672	
 36673	THE NYMPH: _(Her features hardening, gropes in the folds of her habit)_
 36674	Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! _(A large moist stain appears on her
 36675	robe)_ Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a
 36676	pure woman. _(She clutches again in her robe)_ Wait. Satan, you'll sing
 36677	no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. _(She draws a poniard and,
 36678	clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his
 36679	loins)_ Nekum!
 36680	
 36681	BLOOM: _(Starts up, seizes her hand)_ Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat o' nine lives!
 36682	Fair play, madam. No pruningknife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What
 36683	do you lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? _(He
 36684	clutches her veil)_ A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener,
 36685	or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier, or good mother Alphonsus,
 36686	eh Reynard?
 36687	
 36688	THE NYMPH: _(With a cry flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast
 36689	cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks)_ Poli...!
 36690	
 36691	BLOOM: _(Calls after her)_ As if you didn't get it on the double
 36692	yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it.
 36693	Your strength our weakness. What's our studfee? What will you pay on
 36694	the nail? You fee mendancers on the Riviera, I read. _(The fleeing nymph
 36695	raises a keen)_ Eh? I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind
 36696	me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool
 36697	someone else, not me. _(He sniffs)_ Rut. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.
 36698	
 36699	_(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)_
 36700	
 36701	BELLA: You'll know me the next time.
 36702	
 36703	BLOOM: _(Composed, regards her) PassÃ©e._ Mutton dressed as lamb. Long
 36704	in the tooth and superfluous hair. A raw onion the last thing at night
 36705	would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your
 36706	eyes are as vapid as the glasseyes of your stuffed fox. They have the
 36707	dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw
 36708	propeller.
 36709	
 36710	BELLA: _(Contemptuously)_ You're not game, in fact. _(Her sowcunt
 36711	barks)_ Fbhracht!
 36712	
 36713	BLOOM: _(Contemptuously)_ Clean your nailless middle finger first, your
 36714	bully's cold spunk is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of
 36715	hay and wipe yourself.
 36716	
 36717	BELLA: I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!
 36718	
 36719	BLOOM: I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!
 36720	
 36721	BELLA: _(Turns to the piano)_ Which of you was playing the dead march
 36722	from _Saul?_
 36723	
 36724	ZOE: Me. Mind your cornflowers. _(She darts to the piano and bangs
 36725	chords on it with crossed arms)_ The cat's ramble through the slag.
 36726	_(She glances back)_ Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? _(She darts
 36727	back to the table)_ What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.
 36728	
 36729	_(Kitty, disconcerted, coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom
 36730	approaches Zoe.)_
 36731	
 36732	BLOOM: _(Gently)_ Give me back that potato, will you?
 36733	
 36734	ZOE: Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.
 36735	
 36736	BLOOM: _(With feeling)_ It is nothing, but still, a relic of poor mamma.
 36737	
 36738	ZOE:
 36739	
 36740	     Give a thing and take it back
 36741	     God'll ask you where is that
 36742	     You'll say you don't know
 36743	     God'll send you down below.
 36744	
 36745	BLOOM: There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.
 36746	
 36747	STEPHEN: To have or not to have that is the question.
 36748	
 36749	ZOE: Here. _(She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh,
 36750	and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking)_ Those that hides
 36751	knows where to find.
 36752	
 36753	BELLA: _(Frowns)_ Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you
 36754	smash that piano. Who's paying here?
 36755	
 36756	_(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out
 36757	a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)_
 36758	
 36759	STEPHEN: _(With exaggerated politeness)_ This silken purse I made out
 36760	of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. _(He
 36761	indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom)_ We are all in the same sweepstake,
 36762	Kinch and Lynch. _Dans ce bordel ou tenons nostre Ã©tat_.
 36763	
 36764	LYNCH: _(Calls from the hearth)_ Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.
 36765	
 36766	STEPHEN: _(Hands Bella a coin)_ Gold. She has it.
 36767	
 36768	BELLA: _(Looks at the money, then at Stephen, then at Zoe, Florry and
 36769	Kitty)_ Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.
 36770	
 36771	STEPHEN: _(Delightedly)_ A hundred thousand apologies. _(He fumbles
 36772	again and takes out and hands her two crowns)_ Permit, _brevi manu_, my
 36773	sight is somewhat troubled.
 36774	
 36775	_(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to
 36776	himself in monosyllables. Zoe bends over the table. Kitty leans over
 36777	Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist,
 36778	adds his head to the group.)_
 36779	
 36780	FLORRY: _(Strives heavily to rise)_ Ow! My foot's asleep. _(She limps
 36781	over to the table. Bloom approaches.)_
 36782	
 36783	BELLA, ZOE, KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM: _(Chattering and squabbling)_ The
 36784	gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three... allow me a
 36785	moment... this gentleman pays separate... who's touching it?... ow!
 36786	... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short
 36787	time?... who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentleman paid
 36788	down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.
 36789	
 36790	STEPHEN: _(At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence)_ No bottles!
 36791	What, eleven? A riddle!
 36792	
 36793	ZOE: _(Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the
 36794	top of her stocking)_ Hard earned on the flat of my back.
 36795	
 36796	LYNCH: _(Lifting Kitty from the table)_ Come!
 36797	
 36798	KITTY: Wait. _(She clutches the two crowns)_
 36799	
 36800	FLORRY: And me?
 36801	
 36802	LYNCH: Hoopla! _(He lifts her, carries her and bumps her down on the
 36803	sofa.)_
 36804	
 36805	STEPHEN:
 36806	
 36807	     The fox crew, the cocks flew,
 36808	     The bells in heaven
 36809	     Were striking eleven.
 36810	     'Tis time for her poor soul
 36811	     To get out of heaven.
 36812	
 36813	BLOOM: _(Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between bella and
 36814	florry)_ So. Allow me. _(He takes up the poundnote)_ Three times ten.
 36815	We're square.
 36816	
 36817	BELLA: _(Admiringly)_ You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss
 36818	you.
 36819	
 36820	ZOE: _(Points)_ Him? Deep as a drawwell. _(Lynch bends Kitty back over
 36821	the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)_
 36822	
 36823	BLOOM: This is yours.
 36824	
 36825	STEPHEN: How is that? _Les distrait_ or absentminded beggar. _(He
 36826	fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object
 36827	fills.)_ That fell.
 36828	
 36829	BLOOM: _(Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches)_ This.
 36830	
 36831	STEPHEN: Lucifer. Thanks.
 36832	
 36833	BLOOM: _(Quietly)_ You had better hand over that cash to me to take care
 36834	of. Why pay more?
 36835	
 36836	STEPHEN: _(Hands him all his coins)_ Be just before you are generous.
 36837	
 36838	BLOOM: I will but is it wise? _(He counts)_ One, seven, eleven, and
 36839	five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.
 36840	
 36841	STEPHEN: Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next
 36842	Lessing says. Thirsty fox. _(He laughs loudly)_ Burying his grandmother.
 36843	Probably he killed her.
 36844	
 36845	BLOOM: That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.
 36846	
 36847	STEPHEN: Doesn't matter a rambling damn.
 36848	
 36849	BLOOM: No, but...
 36850	
 36851	STEPHEN: _(Comes to the table)_ Cigarette, please. _(Lynch tosses a
 36852	cigarette from the sofa to the table)_ And so Georgina Johnson is dead
 36853	and married. _(A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it)_
 36854	Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. _(He strikes a match and proceeds to
 36855	light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy)_
 36856	
 36857	LYNCH: _(Watching him)_ You would have a better chance of lighting it if
 36858	you held the match nearer.
 36859	
 36860	STEPHEN: _(Brings the match near his eye)_ Lynx eye. Must get glasses.
 36861	Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all
 36862	flat. _(He draws the match away. It goes out.)_ Brain thinks. Near:
 36863	far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. _(He frowns mysteriously)_ Hm.
 36864	Sphinx. The beast that has twobacks at midnight. Married.
 36865	
 36866	ZOE: It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with
 36867	him.
 36868	
 36869	FLORRY: _(Nods)_ Mr Lambe from London.
 36870	
 36871	STEPHEN: Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.
 36872	
 36873	LYNCH: _(Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply) Dona nobis pacem._
 36874	
 36875	_(The cigarette slips from Stephen 's fingers. Bloom picks it up and
 36876	throws it in the grate.)_
 36877	
 36878	BLOOM: Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. _(To Zoe)_ You
 36879	have nothing?
 36880	
 36881	ZOE: Is he hungry?
 36882	
 36883	STEPHEN: _(Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the
 36884	bloodoath in the_ Dusk of the Gods)
 36885	
 36886	     Hangende Hunger,
 36887	     Fragende Frau,
 36888	     Macht uns alle kaputt.
 36889	
 36890	
 36891	ZOE: _(Tragically)_ Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! _(She takes
 36892	his hand)_ Blue eyes beauty I'll read your hand. _(She points to his
 36893	forehead)_ No wit, no wrinkles. _(She counts)_ Two, three, Mars, that's
 36894	courage. _(Stephen shakes his head)_ No kid.
 36895	
 36896	LYNCH: Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and
 36897	shake. _(To Zoe)_ Who taught you palmistry?
 36898	
 36899	ZOE: _(Turns)_ Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. _(To Stephen)_ I see
 36900	it in your face. The eye, like that. _(She frowns with lowered head)_
 36901	
 36902	LYNCH: _(Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice)_ Like that. Pandybat.
 36903	
 36904	_(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open,
 36905	the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)_
 36906	
 36907	FATHER DOLAN: Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little
 36908	schemer. See it in your eye.
 36909	
 36910	_(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises
 36911	from the pianola coffin.)_
 36912	
 36913	DON JOHN CONMEE: Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very
 36914	good little boy!
 36915	
 36916	ZOE: _(Examining Stephen's palm)_ Woman's hand.
 36917	
 36918	STEPHEN: _(Murmurs)_ Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read
 36919	His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.
 36920	
 36921	ZOE: What day were you born?
 36922	
 36923	STEPHEN: Thursday. Today.
 36924	
 36925	ZOE: Thursday's child has far to go. _(She traces lines on his hand)_
 36926	Line of fate. Influential friends.
 36927	
 36928	FLORRY: _(Pointing)_ Imagination.
 36929	
 36930	ZOE: Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... _(She peers at his hands
 36931	abruptly)_ I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to
 36932	know?
 36933	
 36934	BLOOM: _(Detaches her fingers and offers his palm)_ More harm than good.
 36935	Here. Read mine.
 36936	
 36937	BELLA: Show. _(She turns up bloom's hand)_ I thought so. Knobby knuckles
 36938	for the women.
 36939	
 36940	ZOE: _(Peering at bloom's palm)_ Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and
 36941	marry money.
 36942	
 36943	BLOOM: Wrong.
 36944	
 36945	ZOE: _(Quickly)_ O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That
 36946	wrong?
 36947	
 36948	_(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises,
 36949	stretches her wings and clucks.)_
 36950	
 36951	BLACK LIZ: Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.
 36952	
 36953	_(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off)_
 36954	
 36955	BLOOM: _(Points to his hand)_ That weal there is an accident. Fell and
 36956	cut it twentytwo years ago. I was sixteen.
 36957	
 36958	ZOE: I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.
 36959	
 36960	STEPHEN: See? Moves to one great goal. I am twentytwo. Sixteen years ago
 36961	he was twentytwo too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled. Twentytwo
 36962	years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. _(He winces)_ Hurt my hand
 36963	somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?
 36964	
 36965	_(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and
 36966	writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)_
 36967	
 36968	FLORRY: What?
 36969	
 36970	_(A hackneycar, number three hundred and twentyfour, with a
 36971	gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue,
 36972	Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the
 36973	sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the
 36974	crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)_
 36975	
 36976	THE BOOTS: _(Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers)_
 36977	Haw haw have you the horn?
 36978	
 36979	_(Bronze by gold they whisper.)_
 36980	
 36981	ZOE: _(To Florry)_ Whisper.
 36982	
 36983	_(They whisper again)_
 36984	
 36985	_(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set
 36986	sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan in yachtsman's cap and
 36987	white shoes officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan's coat
 36988	shoulder.)_
 36989	
 36990	LENEHAN: Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a
 36991	few quims?
 36992	
 36993	BOYLAN: _(Seated, smiles)_ Plucking a turkey.
 36994	
 36995	LENEHAN: A good night's work.
 36996	
 36997	BOYLAN: _(Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks)_ Blazes
 36998	Kate! Up to sample or your money back. _(He holds out a forefinger)_
 36999	Smell that.
 37000	
 37001	LENEHAN: _(Smells gleefully)_ Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!
 37002	
 37003	ZOE AND FLORRY: _(Laugh together)_ Ha ha ha ha.
 37004	
 37005	BOYLAN: _(Jumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear)_
 37006	Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom dressed yet?
 37007	
 37008	BLOOM: _(In flunkey's prune plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings
 37009	and powdered wig)_ I'm afraid not, sir. The last articles...
 37010	
 37011	BOYLAN: _(Tosses him sixpence)_ Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash.
 37012	_(He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head)_ Show me
 37013	in. I have a little private business with your wife, you understand?
 37014	
 37015	BLOOM: Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.
 37016	
 37017	MARION: He ought to feel himself highly honoured. _(She plops splashing
 37018	out of the water)_ Raoul darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only
 37019	my new hat and a carriage sponge.
 37020	
 37021	BOYLAN: _(A merry twinkle in his eye)_ Topping!
 37022	
 37023	BELLA: What? What is it?
 37024	
 37025	_(Zoe whispers to her.)_
 37026	
 37027	MARION: Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll
 37028	write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to
 37029	raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed
 37030	and stamped receipt.
 37031	
 37032	BOYLAN: (clasps himself) Here, I can't hold this little lot much longer.
 37033	(he strides off on stiff cavalry legs)
 37034	
 37035	BELLA: _(Laughing)_ Ho ho ho ho.
 37036	
 37037	BOYLAN: _(To Bloom, over his shoulder)_ You can apply your eye to the
 37038	keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.
 37039	
 37040	BLOOM: Thank you, sir. I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness
 37041	the deed and take a snapshot? _(He holds out an ointment jar)_ Vaseline,
 37042	sir? Orangeflower...? Lukewarm water...?
 37043	
 37044	KITTY: _(From the sofa)_ Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.
 37045	
 37046	_(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur, liplapping
 37047	loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)_
 37048	
 37049	MINA KENNEDY: _(Her eyes upturned)_ O, it must be like the scent of
 37050	geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her!
 37051	Stuck together! Covered with kisses!
 37052	
 37053	LYDIA DOUCE: _(Her mouth opening)_ Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round
 37054	the room doing it! Ride a cockhorse. You could hear them in Paris and
 37055	New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.
 37056	
 37057	KITTY: _(Laughing)_ Hee hee hee.
 37058	
 37059	BOYLAN'S VOICE: _(Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach)_ Ah!
 37060	Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!

 37068	BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY, KITTY: Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!
 37069	
 37070	LYNCH: _(Points)_ The mirror up to nature. _(He laughs)_ Hu hu hu hu hu!
 37071	
 37072	_(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare,
 37073	beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the
 37074	reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)_
 37075	
 37076	SHAKESPEARE: _(In dignified ventriloquy)_ 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks
 37077	the vacant mind. _(To Bloom)_ Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest
 37078	invisible. Gaze. _(He crows with a black capon's laugh)_ Iagogo! How my
 37079	Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymornun. Iagogogo!

 37081	BLOOM: _(Smiles yellowly at the three whores)_ When will I hear the
 37082	joke?
 37083	
 37084	ZOE: Before you're twice married and once a widower.
 37085	
 37086	BLOOM: Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon when measurements
 37087	were taken next the skin after his death...

 37089	_(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with
 37090	deathtalk, tears and Tunney's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds,
 37091	her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a
 37092	pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late
 37093	husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, large eights. She holds
 37094	a Scottish widows' insurance policy and a large marquee umbrella under
 37095	which her brood run with her, Patsy hopping on one shod foot, his collar
 37096	loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, freddy whimpering, Susy with a
 37097	crying cod's mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on,

 37106	_(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeare's
 37107	beardless face. The marquee umbrella sways drunkenly, the children run

 37119	Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgrossfather made the first
 37120	confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions

 37543	THE MOTHER: _(In the agony of her deathrattle)_ Have mercy on Stephen,
 37544	Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love,
 37545	grief and agony on Mount Calvary.
 37546	
 37547	STEPHEN: _Nothung_!

 37549	_(He lifts his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier.
 37550	Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of

 37563	beats the ground and flies from the room, past the whores at the door.)_
 37564	
 37565	BELLA: _(Screams)_ After him!
 37566	
 37567	_(The two whores rush to the halldoor. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede
 37568	from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)_
 37569	
 37570	THE WHORES: _(Jammed in the doorway, pointing)_ Down there.
 37571	
 37572	ZOE: _(Pointing)_ There. There's something up.
 37573	
 37574	BELLA: Who pays for the lamp? _(She seizes Bloom's coattail)_ Here, you
 37575	were with him. The lamp's broken.
 37576	
 37577	BLOOM: _(Rushes to the hall, rushes back)_ What lamp, woman?
 37578	
 37579	A WHORE: He tore his coat.
 37580	
 37581	BELLA: _(Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points)_ Who's to pay
 37582	for that? Ten shillings. You're a witness.
 37583	
 37584	BLOOM: _(Snatches up Stephen's ashplant)_ Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you
 37585	lifted enough off him? Didn't he...?
 37586	
 37587	BELLA: _(Loudly)_ Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A
 37588	ten shilling house.
 37589	
 37590	BLOOM: _(His head under the lamp, pulls the chain. Puling, the gasjet
 37591	lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.)_ Only
 37592	the chimney's broken. Here is all he...
 37593	
 37594	BELLA: _(Shrinks back and screams)_ Jesus! Don't!
 37595	
 37596	BLOOM: _(Warding off a blow)_ To show you how he hit the paper. There's
 37597	not sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!
 37598	
 37599	FLORRY: _(With a glass of water, enters)_ Where is he?
 37600	
 37601	BELLA: Do you want me to call the police?
 37602	
 37603	BLOOM: O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student.
 37604	Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. _(He makes
 37605	a masonic sign)_ Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You
 37606	don't want a scandal.
 37607	
 37608	BELLA: _(Angrily)_ Trinity. Coming down here ragging after the boatraces
 37609	and paying nothing. Are you my commander here or? Where is he? I'll
 37610	charge him! Disgrace him, I will! (She Shouts) Zoe! Zoe!
 37611	
 37612	BLOOM: _(Urgently)_ And if it were your own son in Oxford? _(Warningly)_
 37613	I know.
 37614	
 37615	BELLA: _(Almost speechless)_ Who are. Incog!
 37616	
 37617	ZOE: _(In the doorway)_ There's a row on.
 37618	
 37619	BLOOM: What? Where? _(He throws a shilling on the table and starts)_
 37620	That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air.
 37621	
 37622	_(He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows,
 37623	spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores
 37624	clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared
 37625	off. From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front
 37626	of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is
 37627	about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts
 37628	his face. Bella from within the hall urges on her whores. They blow
 37629	ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghastly
 37630	lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty
 37631	still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood
 37632	and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun
 37633	al Raschid he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the
 37634	railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn
 37635	envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack
 37636	of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in
 37637	tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follow from fir, picking
 37638	up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing
 37639	their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks,
 37640	runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel,

 37685	
 37686	CISSY CAFFREY: I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to

 37688	the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.

 37694	
 37695	CISSY CAFFREY: Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.

 37697	PRIVATE COMPTON: He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff
 37698	him one, Harry.
 37699	
 37700	PRIVATE CARR: _(To Cissy)_ Was he insulting you while me and him was

 37706	PRIVATE COMPTON: Biff him, Harry.
 37707	
 37708	STEPHEN: _(To Private Compton)_ I don't know your name but you are quite
 37709	right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their
 37710	shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.
 37711	
 37712	CISSY CAFFREY: _(To The Crowd)_ No, I was with the privates.
 37713	
 37714	STEPHEN: _(Amiably)_ Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every
 37715	lady for example...
 37716	
 37717	PRIVATE CARR: _(His cap awry, advances to Stephen)_ Say, how would it
 37718	be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?
 37719	
 37720	STEPHEN: _(Looks up to the sky)_ How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of
 37721	selfpretence. Personally, I detest action. _(He waves his hand)_ Hand
 37722	hurts me slightly. _Enfin ce sont vos oignons._ _(To Cissy Caffrey)_
 37723	Some trouble is on here. What is it precisely?

 37725	DOLLY GRAY: _(From her balcony waves her handkerchief, giving the sign
 37726	of the heroine of Jericho)_ Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to

 37732	vigorously)_ Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.
 37733	
 37734	STEPHEN: _(Turns)_ Eh? _(He disengages himself)_ Why should I not speak
 37735	to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange?
 37736	_(He points his finger)_ I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see
 37737	his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.

 37740	
 37741	BLOOM: _(Propping him)_ Retain your own.
 37742	
 37743	STEPHEN: _(Laughs emptily)_ My centre of gravity is displaced. I have
 37744	forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle
 37745	for life is the law of existence but but human philirenists, notably the
 37746	tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. _(He taps his
 37747	brow)_ But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.
 37748	
 37749	BIDDY THE CLAP: Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor
 37750	out of the college.
 37751	
 37752	CUNTY KATE: I did. I heard that.
 37753	
 37754	BIDDY THE CLAP: He expresses himself with such marked refinement of
 37755	phraseology.
 37756	
 37757	CUNTY KATE: Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite
 37758	trenchancy.

 37761	you're saying about my king?

 37766	and Probyn's horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable
 37767	artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed
 37768	as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron,
 37769	marked_ made in Germany. _In his left hand he holds a plasterer's bucket
 37770	on which is printed_ DÃ©fense d'uriner. _A roar of welcome greets him.)_
 37771	
 37772	EDWARD THE SEVENTH: _(Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly)_ Peace, perfect
 37773	peace. For identification, bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. _(He turns
 37774	to his subjects)_ We have come here to witness a clean straight fight
 37775	and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a bak.

 37778	Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts his bucket graciously
 37779	in acknowledgment.)_
 37780	
 37781	PRIVATE CARR: _(To Stephen)_ Say it again.
 37782	
 37783	STEPHEN: _(Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up)_ I understand your point
 37784	of view though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of
 37785	patent medicines. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the
 37786	point. You die for your country. Suppose. _(He places his arm on Private
 37787	Carr's sleeve)_ Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country
 37788	die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I didn't want it to die.
 37789	Damn death. Long live life!
 37790	
 37791	EDWARD THE SEVENTH: _(Levitates over heaps of slain, in the garb and
 37792	with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent
 37793	face)_
 37794	
 37795	My methods are new and are causing surprise. To make the blind see I
 37796	throw dust in their eyes.

 37799	we'll... What was that girl saying?...
 37800	
 37801	PRIVATE COMPTON: Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one
 37802	into Jerry.
 37803	
 37804	BLOOM: _(To the privates, softly)_ He doesn't know what he's saying.
 37805	Taken a little more than is good for him. Absinthe. Greeneyed monster. I
 37806	know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.
 37807	
 37808	STEPHEN: _(Nods, smiling and laughing)_ Gentleman, patriot, scholar and
 37809	judge of impostors.

 37811	PRIVATE CARR: I don't give a bugger who he is.
 37812	
 37813	PRIVATE COMPTON: We don't give a bugger who he is.

 37837	BIDDY THE CLAP: One immediately observes that he is of patrician

 37940	
 37941	BLOOM: _(To the redcoats)_ We fought for you in South Africa, Irish

 38190	CORNY KELLEHER: I'll see to that.

 38194	any scandal, you understand. Father is a wellknown highly respected
 38195	citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.

 38198	
 38199	SECOND WATCH: That's all right, sir.
 38200	
 38201	FIRST WATCH: It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have to report
 38202	it at the station.
 38203	
 38204	BLOOM: _(Nods rapidly)_ Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.
 38205

 38207	
 38208	CORNY KELLEHER: Good night, men.
 38209	
 38210	THE WATCH: _(Saluting together)_ Night, gentlemen. _(They move off with
 38211	slow heavy tread)_
 38212	
 38213	BLOOM: _(Blows)_ Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?...
 38214	
 38215	CORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to
 38216	the car brought up against the scaffolding)_ Two commercials that were
 38217	standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two
 38218	quid on the race. Drowning his grief. And were on for a go with the
 38219	jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.
 38220	
 38221	BLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...
 38222	
 38223	CORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs)_ Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots.
 38224	No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. _(He
 38225	laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye)_ Thanks be to God we have it
 38226	in the house, what, eh, do you follow me? Hah, hah, hah!
 38227	
 38228	BLOOM: _(Tries to laugh)_ He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just
 38229	visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor
 38230	fellow, he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and
 38231	I was just making my way home...
 38232	
 38233	_(The horse neighs.)_
 38234	
 38235	THE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!
 38236	
 38237	CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after
 38238	we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and
 38239	got off to see. _(He laughs)_ Sober hearsedrivers a speciality. Will I
 38240	give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?
 38241	
 38242	BLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.
 38243	
 38244	_(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher, asquint, drawls
 38245	at the horse. Bloom, in gloom, looms down.)_
 38246	
 38247	CORNY KELLEHER: _(Scratches his nape)_ Sandycove! _(He bends down and
 38248	calls to Stephen)_ Eh! _(He calls again)_ Eh! He's covered with shavings
 38249	anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.
 38250	
 38251	BLOOM: No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.
 38252	
 38253	CORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll
 38254	shove along. _(He laughs)_ I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the
 38255	dead. Safe home!
 38256	
 38257	THE HORSE: _(Neighs)_ Hohohohohome.
 38258	
 38259	BLOOM: Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...
 38260	
 38261	_(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse
 38262	harness jingles.)_
 38263	
 38264	CORNY KELLEHER: _(From the car, standing)_ Night.
 38265	
 38266	BLOOM: Night.
 38267	
 38268	_(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The
 38269	car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn. Corny Kelleher on the
 38270	sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom's plight.
 38271	The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the
 38272	farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb
 38273	and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the
 38274	sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom
 38275	conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car
 38276	jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher
 38277	again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny
 38278	Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling
 38279	harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay. Bloom, holding
 38280	in his hand Stephen's hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands
 38281	irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)_
 38282	
 38283	BLOOM: Eh! Ho! _(There is no answer; he bends again)_ Mr Dedalus!
 38284	_(There is no answer)_ The name if you call. Somnambulist. _(He bends
 38285	again and hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate
 38286	form)_ Stephen! _(There is no answer. He calls again.)_ Stephen!
 38287	
 38288	STEPHEN: _(Groans)_ Who? Black panther. Vampire. _(He sighs and
 38289	stretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels)_

 38291	     Who... drive... Fergus now
 38292	     And pierce... wood's woven shade?...
 38293	
 38294	_(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)_
 38295	
 38296	BLOOM: Poetry. Well educated. Pity. _(He bends again and undoes
 38297	the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat)_ To breathe. _(He brushes the
 38298	woodshavings from Stephen's clothes with light hand and fingers)_ One
 38299	pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. _(He listens)_ What?

 38301	STEPHEN: _(Murmurs)_
 38302	
 38303	    ... shadows... the woods

 38306	_(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom,
 38307	holding the hat and ashplant, stands erect. A dog barks in the distance.
 38308	Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on
 38309	Stephen's face and form.)_
 38310	
 38311	BLOOM: _(Communes with the night)_ Face reminds me of his poor mother.
 38312	In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A
 38313	girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him. _(He murmurs)_... swear
 38314	that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts,
 38315	art or arts... _(He murmurs)_... in the rough sands of the sea... a
 38316	cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs... and flows
 38317	...

 38319	_(Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips
 38320	in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears
 38321	slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an
 38322	eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book
 38323	in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the
 38324	page.)_

 38336	-- III --
 38337	
 38338	Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of
 38339	the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up
 38340	generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. His
 38341	(Stephen's) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit
 38342	unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr
 38343	Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water
 38344	available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an
 38345	expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman's
 38346	shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge
 38347	where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and
 38348	soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he
 38349	was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him
 38350	to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means
 38351	during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was
 38352	rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable
 38353	to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their
 38354	then condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always
 38355	assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly after a
 38356	few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten
 38357	to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman
 38358	service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver
 38359	street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier's and the
 38360	distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of
 38361	Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence
 38362	debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin's. But
 38363	as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for
 38364	hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some
 38365	fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was
 38366	no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was
 38367	anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting
 38368	a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.
 38369	
 38370	This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently
 38371	there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it
 38372	which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett's and the
 38373	Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the
 38374	direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped
 38375	by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,
 38376	to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,
 38377	entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made
 38378	light of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed
 38379	for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it
 38380	cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered
 38381	along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a
 38382	jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company's sandstrewer
 38383	happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _Ã 
 38384	propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little
 38385	while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway
 38386	station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was
 38387	suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue
 38388	(a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more
 38389	especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course
 38390	turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.
 38391	Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford
 38392	place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird's the
 38393	stonecutter's in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the
 38394	right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled
 38395	with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke's city bakery,
 38396	situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed
 38397	of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and
 38398	most indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me
 38399	where is fancy bread, at Rourke's the baker's it is said.
 38400	
 38401	_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not
 38402	yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete
 38403	possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober,
 38404	spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame
 38405	and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not
 38406	as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for
 38407	young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking
 38408	habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu
 38409	for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could
 38410	administer a nasty kick if you didn't look out. Highly providential
 38411	was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was
 38412	blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the
 38413	eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a
 38414	candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and
 38415	an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the
 38416	solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply
 38417	spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason he mentioned
 38418	the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked,
 38419	were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr
 38420	Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil
 38421	street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on
 38422	the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for
 38423	example, the
 38424	
 38425	guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being
 38426	they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented
 38427	on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description
 38428	liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them
 38429	against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything. You
 38430	frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and
 38431	also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women
 38432	of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of l s. d. into the bargain and
 38433	the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching
 38434	the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old
 38435	wine in season as both
 38436	
 38437	nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a
 38438	good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond
 38439	a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to
 38440	trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of
 38441	others practically. Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion
 38442	of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confreres_ but one, a most glaring
 38443	piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.
 38444	
 38445	--And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing
 38446	whatsoever of any kind.
 38447	
 38448	Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back
 38449	of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier
 38450	of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted
 38451	their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for
 38452	no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by
 38453	the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker
 38454	figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He
 38455	began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having
 38456	happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered
 38457	that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's,
 38458	Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway
 38459	bridge.
 38460	
 38461	--Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.
 38462	
 38463	A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches
 38464	saluted again, calling:
 38465	
 38466	--_Night!_
 38467	
 38468	Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the
 38469	compliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch
 38470	as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but
 38471	nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety
 38472	though not funkyish in the least. Though unusual in the Dublin area he
 38473	knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next
 38474	to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising
 38475	peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some
 38476	secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the
 38477	Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply
 38478	marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell
 38479	swoop at a moment's notice, your money or your life, leaving you there
 38480	to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.
 38481	
 38482	Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,
 38483	though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley's
 38484	breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him
 38485	and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of
 38486	inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married
 38487	a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His
 38488	grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow
 38489	of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.
 38490	Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of
 38491	the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably
 38492	fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or
 38493	some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed
 38494	the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This therefore
 38495	was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute
 38496	man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious
 38497	proclivities as Lord John Corley.
 38498	
 38499	Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.
 38500	Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. His friends
 38501	had all deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called
 38502	him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other
 38503	uncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to
 38504	tell him where on God's earth he could get something, anything at all,
 38505	to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that
 38506	was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected
 38507	through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same
 38508	time if the whole thing wasn't a complete fabrication from start to
 38509	finish. Anyhow he was all in.
 38510	
 38511	--I wouldn't ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows
 38512	I'm on the rocks.
 38513	
 38514	--There'll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys'
 38515	school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You
 38516	may mention my name.
 38517	
 38518	--Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man. I was
 38519	never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck
 38520	twice in the junior at the christian brothers.
 38521	
 38522	--I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.
 38523	
 38524	Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to
 38525	do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody
 38526	tart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs
 38527	Maloney's, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but
 38528	M'Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over
 38529	in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person
 38530	addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he
 38531	hadn't said a word about it.
 38532	
 38533	Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it
 38534	still Stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew
 38535	that Corley's brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly
 38536	deserving of much credence. However _haud ignarus malorum miseris
 38537	succurrere disco_ etcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck
 38538	would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on
 38539	the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though
 38540	a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke
 38541	was nothing would get it out of Corley's head that he was living in
 38542	affluence and hadn't a thing to do but hand out the needful. Whereas.
 38543	He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food
 38544	there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu
 38545	so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but
 38546	the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash
 38547	missing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.
 38548	He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost
 38549	as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a
 38550	pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact. He was altogether too
 38551	fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.
 38552	About biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them he
 38553	wondered or where was or did he buy. However in another pocket he came
 38554	across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however,
 38555	as it turned out.
 38556	
 38557	--Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.
 38558	
 38559	And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him
 38560	one of them.
 38561	
 38562	--Thanks, Corley answered, you're a gentleman. I'll pay you back one
 38563	time. Who's that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse
 38564	in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker. You might put in a good
 38565	word for us to get me taken on there. I'd carry a sandwichboard only
 38566	the girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks,
 38567	man. God, you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the Carl
 38568	Rosa. I don't give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a
 38569	crossing sweeper.
 38570	
 38571	Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six
 38572	he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky
 38573	that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam's, the shipchandler's,
 38574	bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle's back with O'Mara
 38575	and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow he was lagged
 38576	the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and
 38577	refusing to go with the constable.
 38578	
 38579	210
 38580	
 38581	Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
 38582	cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
 38583	watchman's sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,
 38584	was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own
 38585	private account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time
 38586	now and then at Stephen's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor
 38587	as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was
 38588	not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.
 38589	Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in
 38590	point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated
 38591	hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic
 38592	impecuniosity. Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the
 38593	matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor
 38594	neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for
 38595	the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock
 38596	himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be
 38597	a very rara avis altogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of
 38598	cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.
 38599	Pretty thick that was certainly.
 38600	
 38601	The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his
 38602	practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
 38603	blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said,
 38604	laughingly, Stephen, that is:
 38605	
 38606	--He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named
 38607	Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.
 38608	
 38609	At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr
 38610	Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the
 38611	direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,
 38612	moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,
 38613	whereupon he observed evasively:
 38614	
 38615	--Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it
 38616	his face was familiar to me. But, leaving that for the moment, how much
 38617	did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?
 38618	
 38619	--Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep
 38620	somewhere.
 38621	
 38622	--Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at
 38623	the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he
 38624	invariably does. Everyone according to his needs or everyone according
 38625	to his deeds. But, talking about things in general, where, added he with
 38626	a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of
 38627	the question. And even supposing you did you won't get in after what
 38628	occurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I
 38629	don't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why
 38630	did you leave your father's house?
 38631	
 38632	--To seek misfortune, was Stephen's answer.
 38633	
 38634	--I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom
 38635	diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on
 38636	yesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of
 38637	conversation that he had moved.
 38638	
 38639	--I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.
 38640	Why?
 38641	
 38642	--A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects
 38643	than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one. He takes great
 38644	pride, quite legitimate, out of you. You could go back perhaps, he
 38645	hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row
 38646	terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan,
 38647	that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred
 38648	their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally
 38649	station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion,
 38650	which they did.
 38651	
 38652	There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it
 38653	was, Stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his
 38654	family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by
 38655	the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell
 38656	cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he
 38657	could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings
 38658	they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and
 38659	Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells
 38660	and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in
 38661	accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain
 38662	on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or
 38663	something like that.
 38664	
 38665	--No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn't personally repose much trust
 38666	in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr
 38667	Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes. He
 38668	knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he
 38669	never realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you
 38670	didn't notice as much as I did. But it wouldn't occasion me the least
 38671	surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in
 38672	your drink for some ulterior object.
 38673	
 38674	He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile
 38675	allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly
 38676	coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade
 38677	fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as
 38678	a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services
 38679	in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from
 38680	certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first
 38681	aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an
 38682	exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that
 38683	frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be
 38684	at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy,
 38685	pure and simple.
 38686	
 38687	--Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking
 38688	your brains, he ventured to throw out.
 38689	
 38690	The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by
 38691	friendliness which he gave at Stephen's at present morose expression
 38692	of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the
 38693	problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by
 38694	two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw
 38695	through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself
 38696	allowed matters to more or less. Grinding poverty did have that effect
 38697	and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he
 38698	possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.
 38699	
 38700	Adjacent to the men's public urinal they perceived an icecream car round
 38701	which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting
 38702	rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly
 38703	animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.
 38704	
 38705	--_Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!_
 38706	
 38707	_--Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano piu..._
 38708	
 38709	_--Dice lui, pero!_
 38710	
 38711	_--Mezzo._
 38712	
 38713	_--Farabutto! Mortacci sui!_
 38714	
 38715	_--Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa piu..._
 38716	
 38717	Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious
 38718	wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been
 38719	before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few
 38720	hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat
 38721	Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual
 38722	facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few
 38723	moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner
 38724	only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection
 38725	of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_
 38726	already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation
 38727	for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.
 38728	
 38729	--Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest
 38730	to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the
 38731	shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.
 38732	
 38733	Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order
 38734	these commodities quietly. The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores
 38735	or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes
 38736	apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual
 38737	portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for
 38738	some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the
 38739	floor. Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having
 38740	just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be
 38741	sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protÃ©gÃ©_ in
 38742	an audible tone of voice _a propos_ of the battle royal in the street
 38743	which was still raging fast and furious:
 38744	
 38745	--A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not
 38746	write your poetry in that language? _Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious
 38747	and full. _Belladonna. Voglio._
 38748	
 38749	Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering
 38750	from lassitude generally, replied:
 38751	
 38752	--To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.
 38753	
 38754	--Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the
 38755	inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were
 38756	absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds
 38757	it.
 38758	
 38759	The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tÃªte-Ã¢-tÃªte_ put a
 38760	boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table
 38761	and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. After
 38762	which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have
 38763	a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. For which
 38764	reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did
 38765	the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily
 38766	supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.
 38767	
 38768	--Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,
 38769	like names. Cicero, Podmore. Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle.
 38770	Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What's in a name?
 38771	
 38772	--Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name
 38773	was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.
 38774	
 38775	The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded
 38776	Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely
 38777	by asking:
 38778	
 38779	--And what might your name be?
 38780	
 38781	Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion's boot but
 38782	Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected
 38783	quarter, answered:
 38784	
 38785	--Dedalus.
 38786	
 38787	The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,
 38788	rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old
 38789	Hollands and water.
 38790	
 38791	--You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.
 38792	
 38793	--I've heard of him, Stephen said.
 38794	
 38795	Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently
 38796	eavesdropping too.
 38797	
 38798	--He's Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same
 38799	way and nodding. All Irish.
 38800	
 38801	--All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.
 38802	
 38803	As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business
 38804	and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor
 38805	of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the
 38806	remark:
 38807	
 38808	--I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his
 38809	shoulder. The lefthand dead shot.
 38810	
 38811	Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his
 38812	gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.
 38813	
 38814	--Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles.
 38815	Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.
 38816	
 38817	He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then he
 38818	screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night
 38819	with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.
 38820	
 38821	--Pom! he then shouted once.
 38822	
 38823	The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there
 38824	being still a further egg.
 38825	
 38826	--Pom! he shouted twice.
 38827	
 38828	Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding
 38829	bloodthirstily:
 38830	
 38831	_--Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never will._
 38832	
 38833	A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like
 38834	asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the
 38835	Bisley.
 38836	
 38837	--Beg pardon, the sailor said.
 38838	
 38839	--Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.
 38840	
 38841	--Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic
 38842	influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He
 38843	toured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. I seen him do that in
 38844	Stockholm.
 38845	
 38846	--Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.
 38847	
 38848	--Murphy's my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe.
 38849	Know where that is?
 38850	
 38851	--Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.
 38852	
 38853	--That's right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That's
 38854	where I hails from. I belongs there. That's where I hails from. My
 38855	little woman's down there. She's waiting for me, I know. _For England,
 38856	home and beauty_. She's my own true wife I haven't seen for seven years
 38857	now, sailing about.
 38858	
 38859	Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming
 38860	to the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones,
 38861	a rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a
 38862	number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,
 38863	Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc
 38864	O'Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of
 38865	poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.
 38866	Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the
 38867	absentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he
 38868	finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent
 38869	his better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but
 38870	I've come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grasswidow,
 38871	at the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the
 38872	deep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the
 38873	publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and
 38874	onions. No chair for father. Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on
 38875	her knee, _post mortem_ child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my
 38876	galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I
 38877	remain with much love your brokenhearted husband D B Murphy.
 38878	
 38879	The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one
 38880	of the jarvies with the request:
 38881	
 38882	--You don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?
 38883	
 38884	The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of
 38885	plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was
 38886	passed from hand to hand.
 38887	
 38888	--Thank you, the sailor said.
 38889	
 38890	He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow
 38891	stammers, proceeded:
 38892	
 38893	--We come up this morning eleven o'clock. The threemaster _Rosevean_
 38894	from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this
 38895	afternoon. There's my discharge. See? D. B. Murphy. A. B. S.
 38896	
 38897	In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket
 38898	and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.
 38899	
 38900	--You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,
 38901	leaning on the counter.
 38902	
 38903	--Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I've circumnavigated
 38904	a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and
 38905	North America and South America. We was chased by pirates one voyage.
 38906	I seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,
 38907	the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever
 38908	scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. _Gospodi pomilyou_. That's how the
 38909	Russians prays.
 38910	
 38911	--You seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey.
 38912	
 38913	--Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen
 38914	queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an
 38915	anchor same as I chew that quid.
 38916	
 38917	He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his
 38918	teeth, bit ferociously:
 38919	
 38920	--Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and
 38921	the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent
 38922	me.
 38923	
 38924	He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to
 38925	be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. The
 38926	printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia._
 38927	
 38928	All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage
 38929	women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,
 38930	sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of
 38931	them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.
 38932	
 38933	--Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs
 38934	like breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more
 38935	children.
 38936	
 38937	See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver
 38938	raw.
 38939	
 38940	His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for
 38941	several minutes if not more.
 38942	
 38943	--Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.
 38944	
 38945	Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:
 38946	
 38947	--Glass. That boggles 'em. Glass.
 38948	
 38949	Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the
 38950	card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran
 38951	as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, SeÃ±or A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,
 38952	Chile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.
 38953	Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the
 38954	eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the
 38955	Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which
 38956	occasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat) having
 38957	detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person
 38958	he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours
 38959	after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and
 38960	the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some
 38961	suspicions of our friend's _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in
 38962	a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday
 38963	or Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had
 38964	ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a
 38965	born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained
 38966	a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.
 38967	Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but
 38968	some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that
 38969	the scheme fell through. But even suppose it did come to planking
 38970	down the needful and breaking Boyd's heart it was not so dear, purse
 38971	permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to
 38972	Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.
 38973	The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in
 38974	every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was
 38975	out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth,
 38976	Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of
 38977	the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon
 38978	where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey,
 38979	wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing just
 38980	struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around
 38981	on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert
 38982	tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts,
 38983	Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne,
 38984	Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel
 38985	islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.
 38986	Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies
 38987	on the job, witness Mrs C P M'Coy type lend me your valise and I'll post
 38988	you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the
 38989	Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading
 38990	lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners,
 38991	perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing
 38992	puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of
 38993	bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business
 38994	with pleasure. But who? That was the rub. Also, without being actually
 38995	positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line
 38996	of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the
 38997	Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the
 38998	_tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red
 38999	tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. A
 39000	great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet
 39001	the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e.
 39002	Brown, Robinson and Co.
 39003	
 39004	It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no
 39005	small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the
 39006	system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry
 39007	pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead
 39008	of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me
 39009	for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum
 39010	months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind
 39011	of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her
 39012	spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.
 39013	There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home
 39014	island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora
 39015	of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around
 39016	Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was
 39017	a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow,
 39018	rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly
 39019	wheelmen so long as it didn't come down, and in the wilds of Donegal
 39020	where if report spoke true the _coup d'oeil_ was exceedingly grand
 39021	though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the
 39022	influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the
 39023	signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic
 39024	associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O'Malley, George IV,
 39025	rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt
 39026	with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young
 39027	men's fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the
 39028	cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left
 39029	leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour's run from the
 39030	pillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely
 39031	in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be
 39032	desired. Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of
 39033	curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created
 39034	the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the
 39035	other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.
 39036	
 39037	--I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had
 39038	little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and
 39039	every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house,
 39040	another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added,
 39041	the chinks does.
 39042	
 39043	Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the
 39044	globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.
 39045	
 39046	--And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his
 39047	back. Knife like that.
 39048	
 39049	Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in
 39050	keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.
 39051	
 39052	--In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.
 39053	Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. _Prepare to
 39054	meet your God_, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.
 39055	
 39056	His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further
 39057	questions even should they by any chance want to.
 39058	
 39059	--That's a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable
 39060	_stiletto_.
 39061	
 39062	After which harrowing _denouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he
 39063	snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in
 39064	his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.
 39065	
 39066	--They're great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in
 39067	the dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought
 39068	the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of
 39069	them using knives.
 39070	
 39071	At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance
 39072	is bliss_ Mr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both
 39073	instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the
 39074	strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat,
 39075	_alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid
 39076	from his boiler affair. His inscrutable face which was really a work
 39077	of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed
 39078	the impression that he didn't understand one jot of what was going on.
 39079	Funny, very!
 39080	
 39081	There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading in fits and
 39082	starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the
 39083	natives _choza de_, another the seaman's discharge. Mr Bloom, so far
 39084	as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He
 39085	vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well
 39086	as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the
 39087	land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively
 39088	speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was
 39089	just turned fifteen.
 39090	
 39091	--Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.
 39092	
 39093	The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.
 39094	
 39095	--Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.
 39096	
 39097	The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or
 39098	no.
 39099	
 39100	--Ah, you've touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he
 39101	had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but
 39102	he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust,
 39103	and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.
 39104	
 39105	--What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall the
 39106	boats?
 39107	
 39108	Our _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before
 39109	answering:
 39110	
 39111	--I'm tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.
 39112	Salt junk all the time.
 39113	
 39114	Tired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was not
 39115	likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,
 39116	fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the
 39117	globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed,
 39118	it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly
 39119	what it meant to rule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen
 39120	at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a
 39121	superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the
 39122	not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at
 39123	it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone
 39124	somewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to
 39125	find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes
 39126	and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under,
 39127	tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no
 39128	secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_
 39129	of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in
 39130	all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had
 39131	to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went
 39132	to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the
 39133	other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were
 39134	run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no
 39135	other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the
 39136	public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case
 39137	might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its
 39138	gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had
 39139	to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the
 39140	season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and
 39141	sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the
 39142	Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding
 39143	which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy,
 39144	not to say stormy, weather.
 39145	
 39146	--There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog,
 39147	himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as
 39148	gentleman's valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I've on
 39149	me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I'm game for that job,
 39150	shaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There's my son now, Danny,
 39151	run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper's in Cork where
 39152	he could be drawing easy money.
 39153	
 39154	--What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the
 39155	side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away
 39156	from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy
 39157	getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.
 39158	
 39159	--Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?
 39160	He'd be about eighteen now, way I figure it.
 39161	
 39162	The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow
 39163	shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to
 39164	be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an
 39165	anchor.
 39166	
 39167	--There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.
 39168	I must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It's them black lads I objects
 39169	to. I hate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.
 39170	
 39171	Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged
 39172	his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the
 39173	mariner's hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a
 39174	young man's sideface looking frowningly rather.
 39175	
 39176	--Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were Iying
 39177	becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow, the
 39178	name of Antonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.
 39179	
 39180	--Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.
 39181	
 39182	That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.
 39183	Someway in his. Squeezing or.
 39184	
 39185	--See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. And
 39186	there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his
 39187	fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.
 39188	
 39189	And in point of fact the young man named Antonio's livid face did
 39190	actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the
 39191	unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this
 39192	time stretched over.
 39193	
 39194	--Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He's gone
 39195	too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.
 39196	
 39197	He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression
 39198	of before.
 39199	
 39200	--Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.
 39201	
 39202	--And what's the number for? loafer number two queried.
 39203	
 39204	--Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.
 39205	
 39206	--Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this
 39207	time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the
 39208	direction of the questioner about the number. Ate. A Greek he was.
 39209	
 39210	And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged
 39211	end:
 39212	
 39213	_--As bad as old Antonio, For he left me on my ownio._
 39214	
 39215	The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat
 39216	peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on
 39217	her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr
 39218	Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment
 39219	flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink
 39220	sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had
 39221	laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though
 39222	why pink. His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment
 39223	round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that
 39224	afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the
 39225	lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.)
 39226	and begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing which seemed
 39227	rather vague than not, your washing. Still candour compelled him to
 39228	admit he had washed his wife's undergarments when soiled in Holles
 39229	street and women would and did too a man's similar garments initialled
 39230	with Bewley and Draper's marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really
 39231	loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Still just
 39232	then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female's room more than her
 39233	company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude
 39234	sign to take herself off. Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he
 39235	just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door
 39236	with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all
 39237	there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper
 39238	Murphy's nautical chest and then there was no more of her.
 39239	
 39240	--The gunboat, the keeper said.
 39241	
 39242	--It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,
 39243	how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with
 39244	disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober
 39245	senses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of
 39246	course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.
 39247	Still no matter what the cause is from...
 39248	
 39249	Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely
 39250	remarking:
 39251	
 39252	--In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a
 39253	roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to
 39254	buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.
 39255	
 39256	The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude,
 39257	said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a
 39258	stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from
 39259	any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, w ere
 39260	not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing,
 39261	he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart
 39262	advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of
 39263	the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a
 39264	lasting boon on everybody concerned.
 39265	
 39266	--You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe
 39267	in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such,
 39268	as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I
 39269	believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as
 39270	the convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such
 39271	inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?
 39272	
 39273	Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try
 39274	and concentrate and remember before he could say:
 39275	
 39276	--They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and
 39277	therefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the
 39278	possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I
 39279	can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other
 39280	practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both
 39281	being excluded by court etiquette.
 39282	
 39283	Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
 39284	mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still
 39285	he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly
 39286	rejoining:
 39287	
 39288	--Simple? I shouldn't think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant
 39289	you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a
 39290	blue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for
 39291	instance to invent those rays Rontgen did or the telescope like Edison,
 39292	though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean,
 39293	and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural
 39294	phenomenon such as electricity but it's a horse of quite another colour
 39295	to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.
 39296	
 39297	--O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several
 39298	of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial
 39299	evidence.
 39300	
 39301	On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they
 39302	were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in
 39303	their respective ages, clashed.
 39304	
 39305	--Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his
 39306	original point with a smile of unbelief. I'm not so sure about that.
 39307	That's a matter for everyman's opinion and, without dragging in the
 39308	sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_
 39309	there. My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were
 39310	genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it's the
 39311	big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them
 39312	like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely
 39313	better than I, of course I needn't tell you. Can't you drink that
 39314	coffee, by the way? Let me stir it. And take a piece of that bun. It's
 39315	like one of our skipper's bricks disguised. Still no-one can give what
 39316	he hasn't got. Try a bit.
 39317	
 39318	--Couldn't, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the
 39319	moment refusing to dictate further.
 39320	
 39321	Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir
 39322	or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something
 39323	approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and
 39324	lucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or
 39325	nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in
 39326	run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings
 39327	and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower
 39328	orders. On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection
 39329	they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently
 39330	associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for
 39331	her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was
 39332	to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak
 39333	of. Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he
 39334	remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn't
 39335	remember when it was or where. Anyhow inspection, medical inspection,
 39336	of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly
 39337	accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble's Vi-Cocoa on account of the
 39338	medical analysis involved.
 39339	
 39340	--Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being
 39341	stirred.
 39342	
 39343	Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug
 39344	from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and
 39345	took a sip of the offending beverage.
 39346	
 39347	--Still it's solid food, his good genius urged, I'm a stickler for solid
 39348	food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but
 39349	regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental
 39350	or manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different
 39351	man.
 39352	
 39353	--Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away that
 39354	knife. I can't look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.
 39355	
 39356	Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article,
 39357	a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or
 39358	antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least
 39359	conspicuous point about it.
 39360	
 39361	--Our mutual friend's stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of
 39362	knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_. Do you think they are
 39363	genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and
 39364	lie like old boots. Look at him.
 39365	
 39366	Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was
 39367	full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it
 39368	was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an
 39369	entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent
 39370	probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly
 39371	accurate gospel.
 39372	
 39373	He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and
 39374	Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a
 39375	wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,
 39376	there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail
 39377	delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate
 39378	such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He
 39379	might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told,
 39380	as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself
 39381	and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say
 39382	nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage
 39383	of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who
 39384	expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. On the
 39385	other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because
 39386	meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting
 39387	news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean
 39388	seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.
 39389	And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself
 39390	couldn't probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers
 39391	other fellows coined about him.
 39392	
 39393	--Mind you, I'm not saying that it's all a pure invention, he resumed.
 39394	Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants,
 39395	though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the
 39396	midget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some
 39397	Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn't straighten
 39398	their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he
 39399	proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews
 39400	or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly
 39401	powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as
 39402	gods. There's an example again of simple souls.
 39403	
 39404	However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who
 39405	reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied
 39406	the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the
 39407	management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host
 39408	of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him
 39409	though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually
 39410	fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically
 39411	incompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary that stab in the
 39412	back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he
 39413	was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish
 39414	way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little
 39415	Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows
 39416	except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary
 39417	animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good
 39418	old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on
 39419	the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.
 39420	
 39421	--Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like
 39422	that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own
 39423	hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they
 39424	carry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally.
 39425	My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could
 39426	actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in
 39427	(technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite
 39428	dark, regular brunette, black. I for one certainly believe climate
 39429	accounts for character. That's why I asked you if you wrote your poetry
 39430	in Italian.
 39431	
 39432	--The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very
 39433	passionate about ten shillings. _Roberto ruba roba sua_.
 39434	
 39435	--Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.
 39436	
 39437	--Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown
 39438	listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles
 39439	triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san
 39440	Tommaso Mastino.
 39441	
 39442	--It's in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the
 39443	blood of the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare
 39444	street museum 890 today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call
 39445	it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid
 39446	proportions of hips, bosom. You simply don't knock against those kind of
 39447	women here. An exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a way
 39448	you find but what I'm talking about is the female form. Besides they
 39449	have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a
 39450	woman's natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings, it
 39451	may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it's a thing I simply
 39452	hate to see.
 39453	
 39454	Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the
 39455	others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,
 39456	goo collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course
 39457	had his own say to say. He had doubled the cape a few odd times and
 39458	weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all
 39459	those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him
 39460	or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.
 39461	
 39462	So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt's rock, wreck
 39463	of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for
 39464	the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell
 39465	remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand. That was the talk of the
 39466	town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original
 39467	verse of 910 distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_),
 39468	breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in
 39469	commotion petrified with horror. Then someone said something about the
 39470	case of the s. s. _Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which
 39471	was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all
 39472	hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the _Mona's_, said he
 39473	was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it
 39474	appears, in her hold.
 39475	
 39476	At this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him
 39477	to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.
 39478	
 39479	--Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just
 39480	gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.
 39481	
 39482	He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,
 39483	stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore
 39484	due left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who
 39485	noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's
 39486	rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his
 39487	burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and,
 39488	applying its nozz1e to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of
 39489	it with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a
 39490	shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the
 39491	counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared
 39492	to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when
 39493	duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and
 39494	girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all
 39495	radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person
 39496	or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the
 39497	cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief
 39498	space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently
 39499	giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his
 39500	bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where
 39501	it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoof scooped anyway for
 39502	new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly disturbed in his
 39503	sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation
 39504	stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other
 39505	in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the
 39506	parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human
 39507	probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about
 39508	and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms
 39509	of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent
 39510	form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent
 39511	home comforts all his life who came in for a cool 100 pounds a year
 39512	at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make
 39513	general ducks and drakes of. And there he was at the end of his tether
 39514	after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly
 39515	stiver. He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a
 39516	moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if--a
 39517	big if, however--he had contrived to cure himself of his particular
 39518	partiality.
 39519	
 39520	All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,
 39521	coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same
 39522	thing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin,
 39523	the only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no
 39524	ships ever called.
 39525	
 39526	There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au
 39527	fait_.
 39528	
 39529	What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only
 39530	rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr
 39531	Worthington or some name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, he advised
 39532	them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day's
 39533	work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.
 39534	
 39535	--Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his
 39536	private potation and the rest of his exertions.
 39537	
 39538	That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words
 39539	growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other
 39540	in seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom's sharp ears heard him then expectorate
 39541	the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the
 39542	time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs
 39543	and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in
 39544	he rolled after his successful libation-_cum_-potation, introducing an
 39545	atmosphere of drink into the _soirÃ©e_, boisterously trolling, like a
 39546	veritable son of a seacook:
 39547	
 39548	     _--The biscuits was as hard as brass
 39549	     And the beef as salt as Lot's wife's arse.
 39550	     O, Johnny Lever!
 39551	     Johnny Lever, O!_
 39552	
 39553	After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene
 39554	and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form
 39555	provided. Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to
 39556	grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent
 39557	the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he
 39558	described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on
 39559	the face of God's earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in
 39560	large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year,
 39561	ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of
 39562	it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the
 39563	nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more
 39564	surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly became
 39565	general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal
 39566	thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down
 39567	there in Navan growing tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like
 39568	of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no
 39569	uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in
 39570	store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her
 39571	crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.
 39572	The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he
 39573	affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was
 39574	toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel,
 39575	which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the
 39576	Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped
 39577	their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. His
 39578	advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work
 39579	for Ireland and live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare
 39580	a single one of her sons.
 39581	
 39582	Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_. The impervious
 39583	navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.
 39584	
 39585	--Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a
 39586	bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.
 39587	
 39588	To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper
 39589	concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.
 39590	
 39591	--Who's the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately
 39592	interrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals and
 39593	generals we've got? Tell me that.
 39594	
 39595	--The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial
 39596	blemishes apart.
 39597	
 39598	--That's right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic
 39599	peasant. He's the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?
 39600	
 39601	While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added
 39602	he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman
 39603	worthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few
 39604	irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing
 39605	to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long
 39606	as they didn't indulge in recriminations and come to blows.
 39607	
 39608	From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was
 39609	rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,
 39610	pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was
 39611	fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel,
 39612	unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather
 39613	concealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with
 39614	the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years
 39615	the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as
 39616	time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could
 39617	personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies,
 39618	equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly
 39619	advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even
 39620	though poles apart. Another little interesting point, the amours of
 39621	whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish
 39622	soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in
 39623	fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee
 39624	of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous
 39625	invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as
 39626	being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was
 39627	prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything,
 39628	the others seeing least of the game. And as for the lessee or keeper,
 39629	who probably wasn't the other person at all, he (B.) couldn't help
 39630	feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the
 39631	goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have
 39632	anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their
 39633	felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming
 39634	forward and turning queen's evidence or king's now like Denis or Peter
 39635	Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that he disliked
 39636	those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet, though such
 39637	criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any
 39638	shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly
 39639	remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who
 39640	had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his
 39641	political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to
 39642	any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south,
 39643	have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words
 39644	passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky
 39645	mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on
 39646	his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_
 39647	by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that
 39648	Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual
 39649	perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed,
 39650	actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some
 39651	legal luminary saved his skin on. In any case that was very ancient
 39652	history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he
 39653	had transparently outlived his welcome. He ought to have either died
 39654	naturally or on the scaffold high. Like actresses, always farewell
 39655	positively last performance then come up smiling again. Generous to a
 39656	fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort,
 39657	always snapping at the bone for the shadow. So similarly he had a very
 39658	shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some l s d. in the
 39659	course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere
 39660	of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on. Then as for
 39661	the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he
 39662	told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.
 39663	
 39664	--He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the
 39665	whole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and
 39666	in a heated fashion offensively. So I without deviating from plain facts
 39667	in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his
 39668	family like me though in reality I'm not. That was one for him. A soft
 39669	answer turns away wrath. He hadn't a word to say for himself as everyone
 39670	saw. Am I not right?
 39671	
 39672	He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride
 39673	at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to
 39674	glean in a kind of a way that it wasn't all exactly.
 39675	
 39676	--_Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or
 39677	four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any
 39678	other, _secundum carnem_.
 39679	
 39680	--Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides
 39681	of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to
 39682	right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is
 39683	though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the
 39684	government it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It's all
 39685	very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.
 39686	I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form. It never
 39687	reaches anything or stops anything. A revolution must come on the due
 39688	instalments plan. It's a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate
 39689	people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular,
 39690	in the next house so to speak.
 39691	
 39692	--Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes' war, Stephen
 39693	assented, between Skinner's alley and Ormond market.
 39694	
 39695	Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that
 39696	was overwhelmingly right. And the whole world was full of that sort of
 39697	thing.
 39698	
 39699	--You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of
 39700	conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn't remotely...
 39701	
 39702	All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up
 39703	bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,
 39704	erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were
 39705	very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of
 39706	everything greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.
 39707	
 39708	--They accuse, remarked he audibly.
 39709	
 39710	He turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to, so as
 39711	the others in case they.
 39712	
 39713	--Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen's ear, are accused of
 39714	ruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History, would
 39715	you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the
 39716	inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell,
 39717	an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for,
 39718	imported them. Why? Because they are imbued with the proper spirit. They
 39719	are practical and are proved to be so. I don't want to indulge in any
 39720	because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as
 39721	you are. But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest
 39722	spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead
 39723	America. Turks. It's in the dogma. Because if they didn't believe they'd
 39724	go straight to heaven when they die they'd try to live better, at least
 39725	so I think. That's the juggle on which the p.p's raise the wind on false
 39726	pretences. I'm, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman
 39727	as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see
 39728	everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a
 39729	comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something
 39730	in the neighbourhood of 300 pounds per annum. That's the vital issue
 39731	at stake and it's feasible and would be provocative of friendlier
 39732	intercourse between man and man. At least that's my idea for what it's
 39733	worth. I call that patriotism. _Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering
 39734	of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_. Where you can live
 39735	well, the sense is, if you work.
 39736	
 39737	Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this
 39738	synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.
 39739	He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those
 39740	crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours
 39741	of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere
 39742	beneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or
 39743	didn't say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.
 39744	
 39745	--Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.
 39746	
 39747	The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person
 39748	who owned them pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all
 39749	must work, have to, together.
 39750	
 39751	--I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest
 39752	possible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of
 39753	the thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel
 39754	nowadays. That's work too. Important work. After all, from the little
 39755	I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are
 39756	entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit
 39757	as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the
 39758	peasant has. What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.
 39759	Each is equally important.
 39760	
 39761	--You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may
 39762	be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called
 39763	Ireland for short.
 39764	
 39765	--I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.
 39766	
 39767	--But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important
 39768	because it belongs to me.
 39769	
 39770	--What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under
 39771	some misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the
 39772	latter portion. What was it you...?
 39773	
 39774	Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of
 39775	coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: 1170
 39776	
 39777	--We can't change the country. Let us change the subject.
 39778	
 39779	At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked
 39780	down but in a quandary, as he couldn't tell exactly what construction
 39781	to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some
 39782	kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say the fumes of
 39783	his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way
 39784	foreign to his sober state. Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached
 39785	the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn't
 39786	been familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of fear
 39787	for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air
 39788	of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris,
 39789	the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister,
 39790	failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind
 39791	instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the
 39792	bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance
 39793	there was the case of O'Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist,
 39794	respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries
 39795	among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance
 39796	to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in
 39797	public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual _denouement_
 39798	after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got 1190 landed into hot
 39799	water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint
 39800	to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to
 39801	be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act,
 39802	certain names of those subpoenaed being handed in but not divulged
 39803	for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. Briefly,
 39804	putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a
 39805	deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo
 39806	which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house
 39807	of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir
 39808	apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages
 39809	simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected
 39810	about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to
 39811	morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their
 39812	veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy,
 39813	as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they
 39814	thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were
 39815	always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of
 39816	dress and all the rest of it. Ladies who like distinctive underclothing
 39817	should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider
 39818	between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of
 39819	impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her,
 39820	mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety
 39821	degrees in the shade not caring a continental. However, reverting to the
 39822	original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way
 39823	to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer
 39824	force of natural genius, that. With brains, sir.
 39825	
 39826	For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even
 39827	to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could
 39828	not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the
 39829	bad having in fact let himself in for it. Still to cultivate the
 39830	acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food
 39831	for reflection would amply repay any small. Intellectual stimulation,
 39832	as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.
 39833	Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row,
 39834	old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the
 39835	whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the
 39836	world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.
 39837	coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope
 39838	lately. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet
 39839	with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken
 39840	down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common
 39841	groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per

 39844	The pink edition extra sporting of the _Telegraph_ tell a graphic lie
 39845	lay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling
 39846	again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and the
 39847	preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard was
 39848	addressed A. Boudin find the captain's age, his eyes went aimlessly
 39849	over the respective captions which came under his special province the

 39851	start but it turned out to be only something about somebody named H.

 39858	the late Mr Patrick Dignam.
 39859	
 39860	So to change the subject he read about Dignam R. I. P. which, he
 39861	reflected, was anything but a gay sendoff. Or a change of address
 39862	anyway.
 39863	
 39864	--_This morning_ (Hynes put it in of course) _the remains of the late Mr
 39865	Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue,
 39866	Sandymount, for interment in Glasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a
 39867	most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a
 39868	brief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom
 39869	he is deeply regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the
 39870	deceased were present, were carried out_ (certainly Hynes wrote it with
 39871	a nudge from Corny) _by Messrs H. J. O'Neill and Son, 164 North Strand
 39872	Road. The mourners included: Patk. Dignam (son), Bernard Corrigan

 39874	Power, eatondph 1/8 ador dorador douradora_ (must be where he called
 39875	Monks the dayfather about Keyes's ad) _Thomas Kernan, Simon Dedalus,
 39876	Stephen Dedalus B.,4., Edw. J. Lambert, Cornelius T. Kelleher, Joseph
 39877	M'C Hynes, L. Boom, CP M'Coy,--M'lntosh and several others_.
 39878	
 39879	Nettled not a little by L. _Boom_ (as it incorrectly stated) and the
 39880	line of bitched type but tickled to death simultaneously by C. P. M'Coy
 39881	and Stephen Dedalus B. A. who were conspicuous, needless to say, by
 39882	their total absence (to say nothing of M'Intosh) L. Boom pointed it
 39883	out to his companion B. A. engaged in stifling another yawn, half
 39884	nervousness, not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of
 39885	misprints.
 39886	
 39887	--Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked as soon as his bottom
 39888	jaw would let him, in? Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it.
 39889	
 39890	--It is. Really, Mr Bloom said (though first he fancied he alluded to
 39891	the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there could
 39892	be no possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bit
 39893	flabbergasted at Myles Crawford's after all managing to. There.
 39894	
 39895	While the other was reading it on page two Boom (to give him for the
 39896	nonce his new misnomer) whiled away a few odd leisure moments in fits
 39897	and starts with the account of the third event at Ascot on page three,
 39898	his side. Value 1000 sovs with 3000 sovs in specie added. For entire
 39899	colts and fillies. Mr F. Alexander's _Throwaway_, b. h. by _Rightaway_,
 39900	5 yrs, 9 st 4 lbs (W. Lane) 1, lord Howard de Walden's _Zinfandel_ (M.
 39901	Cannon) z, Mr W. Bass's _Sceptre_ 3. Betting 5 to 4 on _Zinfandel_,
 39902	20 to 1 _Throwaway_ (off). _Sceptre_ a shade heavier, 5 to 4 on
 39903	_Zinfandel_, 20 to 1 _Throwaway_ (off). _Throwaway_ and _Zinfandel_
 39904	stood close order. It was anybody's race then the rank outsider drew to
 39905	the fore, got long lead, beating lord Howard de Walden's chestnut
 39906	colt and Mr W. Bass's bay filly Sceptre on a 2 1/2 mile course. Winner
 39907	trained by Braime so that Lenehan's version of the business was all pure
 39908	buncombe. Secured the verdict cleverly by a length. 1000 sovs with
 39909	3000 in specie. Also ran: J de Bremond's (French horse Bantam Lyons was
 39910	anxiously inquiring after not in yet but expected any minute) _Maximum
 39911	II_. Different ways of bringing off a coup. Lovemaking damages. Though
 39912	that halfbaked Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get
 39913	left. Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing
 39914	though as the event turned out the poor fool hadn't much reason to
 39915	congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it reduced
 39916	itself to eventually.
 39917	
 39918	--There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.
 39919	
 39920	--Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.
 39921	
 39922	One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read:
 39923	_Return of Parnell_. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was
 39924	in that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it
 39925	was killed him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for
 39926	a time after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with
 39927	no-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have gone
 39928	down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered
 39929	his senses. Dead he wasn't. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they
 39930	brought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer
 39931	general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.
 39932	
 39933	All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their
 39934	memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and
 39935	not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it
 39936	was twenty odd years. Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow
 39937	of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly
 39938	inadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in
 39939	his death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when
 39940	his various different political arrangements were nearing completion
 39941	or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to
 39942	change his boots and clothes-after a wetting when a cold resulted and
 39943	failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he
 39944	eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at
 39945	an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken
 39946	out of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements
 39947	even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which
 39948	were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his
 39949	starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the
 39950	remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of
 39951	possibility. Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader
 39952	of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter
 39953	or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas
 39954	Messrs So and So who, though they weren't even a patch on the former
 39955	man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and
 39956	far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay,
 39957	and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual
 39958	mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You had to come
 39959	back. That haunting sense kind of drew you. To show the understudy in
 39960	the title _rÃ´le_ how to. He saw him once on the auspicious occasion
 39961	when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United
 39962	Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact,
 39963	handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_,
 39964	excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding
 39965	the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what's
 39966	bred in the bone. Still as regards return. You were a lucky dog if
 39967	they didn't set the terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot of
 39968	shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And
 39969	then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to
 39970	produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case,
 39971	Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat's name to the best of his
 39972	recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show
 39973	and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he
 39974	might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship
 39975	and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce
 39976	himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace
 39977	remark. A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive,
 39978	in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him,
 39979	would have been to sound the lie of the land first.
 39980	
 39981	--That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor
 39982	commented. She put the first nail in his coffin.
 39983	
 39984	--Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi-disant_ townclerk Henry
 39985	Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. She loosened many a man's thighs.
 39986	I seen her picture in a barber's. The husband was a captain or an
 39987	officer.
 39988	
 39989	--Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.
 39990	
 39991	This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair
 39992	amount of laughter among his _entourage_. As regards Bloom he, without
 39993	the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of
 39994	the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused
 39995	extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters
 39996	worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed
 39997	between them full of sweet nothings. First it was strictly Platonic till
 39998	nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by
 39999	bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town
 40000	till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few
 40001	evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall
 40002	though the thing was public property all along though not to anything
 40003	like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. Since
 40004	their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite,
 40005	where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file
 40006	from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom
 40007	which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the
 40008	packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses
 40009	swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in
 40010	the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance
 40011	of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same
 40012	fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply
 40013	coined shoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was
 40014	it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with
 40015	nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man
 40016	arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim
 40017	to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask
 40018	in the loved one's smiles. The eternal question of the life connubial,
 40019	needless to say, cropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to
 40020	be another chap in the case, exist between married folk? Poser.
 40021	Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with
 40022	affection, carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of
 40023	manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as
 40024	compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the
 40025	usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in
 40026	the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable
 40027	doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own
 40028	peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly
 40029	likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the
 40030	priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch
 40031	adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman
 40032	service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on
 40033	their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations,
 40034	very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of
 40035	fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass's kick. Looking
 40036	back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of
 40037	dream. And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it
 40038	went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved
 40039	with the times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he
 40040	had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow
 40041	since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or
 40042	south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and
 40043	simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the
 40044	very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that
 40045	wouldn't do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting
 40046	every shred of decency to the winds.
 40047	
 40048	--Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to
 40049	Stephen, about blood and the sun. And, if I don't greatly mistake she
 40050	was Spanish too.
 40051	
 40052	--The king of Spain's daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or
 40053	other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and
 40054	the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and
 40055	so many.
 40056	
 40057	--Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any
 40058	means, I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it
 40059	was as she lived there. So, Spain.
 40060	
 40061	Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him
 40062	by the by of that Cap l street library book out of date, he took out his
 40063	pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly
 40064	finally he.
 40065	
 40066	--Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded
 40067	photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?
 40068	
 40069	Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large
 40070	sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she
 40071	was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously
 40072	low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than
 40073	vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing
 40074	near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old
 40075	Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her
 40076	(the lady's) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about
 40077	something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin's
 40078	premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic
 40079	execution.
 40080	
 40081	--Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom
 40082	indicated. Taken a few years since. In or about ninety six. Very like
 40083	her then.
 40084	
 40085	Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his
 40086	1440 legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of
 40087	Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency
 40088	as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years
 40089	numbered barely sweet sixteen. As for the face it was a speaking
 40090	likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which
 40091	came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the
 40092	best advantage in that getup. She could without difficulty, he said,
 40093	have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of
 40094	the. He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female
 40095	form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later
 40096	than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, 1450 perfectly
 40097	developed as works of art, in the National Museum. Marble could give
 40098	the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest. Yes,
 40099	puritanisme, it does though Saint Joseph's sovereign thievery alors
 40100	(Bandez!) Figne toi trop. Whereas no photo could because it simply
 40101	wasn't art in a word.
 40102	
 40103	The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar's good
 40104	example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for
 40105	itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for
 40106	himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the
 40107	camera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional
 40108	etiquette so. Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet
 40109	wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.
 40110	And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a
 40111	kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.
 40112	Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased
 40113	by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away
 40114	thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the
 40115	other's possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving
 40116	_embonpoint_. In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like
 40117	the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact
 40118	with the starch out. Suppose she was gone when he? I looked for the lamp
 40119	which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of
 40120	his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and
 40121	the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must
 40122	have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot
 40123	with apologies to Lindley Murray.
 40124	
 40125	The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,
 40126	_distinguÃ©_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the
 40127	bunch though you wouldn't think he had it in him yet you would. Besides
 40128	he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though
 40129	at the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of
 40130	makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur
 40131	with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial
 40132	tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest
 40133	stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole
 40134	business. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up
 40135	between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye
 40136	was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and
 40137	compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly
 40138	cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and
 40139	relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course
 40140	intimate. Then the decree _nisi_ and the King's proctor tries to show
 40141	cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made absolute. But as
 40142	for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one
 40143	another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till
 40144	the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for
 40145	the party wronged in due course. He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being
 40146	close to Erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on
 40147	the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader's, who notoriously stuck to
 40148	his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery,
 40149	(leader's) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or
 40150	possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the
 40151	_Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the
 40152	by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or
 40153	something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from
 40154	the facile pens of the O'Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging
 40155	occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune's private morals. Though
 40156	palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though
 40157	carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went
 40158	a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast
 40159	discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a
 40160	pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were
 40161	particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a
 40162	minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that
 40163	of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach,
 40164	fortunately not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell's) a silk one was
 40165	inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was
 40166	the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence
 40167	meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost
 40168	celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away
 40169	from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a
 40170	stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more
 40171	for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what's bred in the bone
 40172	instilled into him in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of
 40173	knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to
 40174	the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you,
 40175	sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the
 40176	legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the
 40177	course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after
 40178	the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory
 40179	after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.
 40180	
 40181	On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes
 40182	of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing 1530
 40183	immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the
 40184	wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case
 40185	for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate
 40186	husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from
 40187	the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial
 40188	moment in a loving position locked in one another's arms, drawing
 40189	attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic
 40190	rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and
 40191	master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not
 40192	receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook
 40193	the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though
 40194	possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite
 40195	possibly there were several others. He personally, being of a sceptical
 40196	bias, believed and didn't make the smallest bones about saying so either
 40197	that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting
 40198	list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world
 40199	and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when,
 40200	neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on
 40201	for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on
 40202	her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred
 40203	on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive
 40204	married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as
 40205	several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.
 40206	
 40207	It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of
 40208	brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time
 40209	with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him
 40210	his lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take
 40211	unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim
 40212	ladies' society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest
 40213	possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen
 40214	about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who
 40215	brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he
 40216	would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea
 40217	and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or
 40218	triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and
 40219	walking out leading up to fond lovers' ways and flowers and chocs. To
 40220	think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any
 40221	stepmother, was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things
 40222	he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the
 40223	other's senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly
 40224	ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal
 40225	nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.
 40226	
 40227	--At what o'clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired
 40228	though unwrinkled face.
 40229	
 40230	--Some time yesterday, Stephen said.
 40231	
 40232	--Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow
 40233	Friday. Ah, you mean it's after twelve!
 40234	
 40235	--The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.
 40236	
 40237	Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.
 40238	Though they didn't see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there
 40239	somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the
 40240	one train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly
 40241	some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to
 40242	parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in
 40243	retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had
 40244	a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance when the
 40245	evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in
 40246	people's mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper
 40247	or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn't
 40248	exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in
 40249	thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern
 40250	opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was
 40251	subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a
 40252	step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time
 40253	inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly
 40254	resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our
 40255	friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan's so that he,
 40256	though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
 40257	mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give
 40258	him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
 40259	themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
 40260	invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
 40261	and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
 40262	fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.
 40263	
 40264	Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it
 40265	was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it
 40266	was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue
 40267	(somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash
 40268	altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed
 40269	unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or
 40270	the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he
 40271	very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the
 40272	other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount
 40273	or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of
 40274	the two alternatives. Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him
 40275	to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.
 40276	His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over
 40277	effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn't what you
 40278	call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was
 40279	he didn't know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he
 40280	did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal
 40281	pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some
 40282	wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding,
 40283	eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps's cocoa and
 40284	a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat
 40285	doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as
 40286	a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm
 40287	in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.
 40288	A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower
 40289	in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn't appear in any
 40290	particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown
 40291	and it was highly likely some sponger's bawdyhouse of retired beauties
 40292	where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue
 40293	to that equivocal character's whereabouts for a few days to come,
 40294	alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids') with sixchamber
 40295	revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze
 40296	the marrow of anybody's bones and mauling their largesized charms
 40297	betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large
 40298	potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who
 40299	he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra
 40300	remarks _passim_. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle
 40301	repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.
 40302	People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled
 40303	them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point too of tender
 40304	Achilles. Your god was a jew. Because mostly they appeared to imagine he
 40305	came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.
 40306	
 40307	--I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while
 40308	prudently pocketing her photo, as it's rather stuffy here you just come
 40309	home with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the
 40310	vicinity. You can't drink that stuff. Do you like cocoa? Wait. I'll just
 40311	pay this lot.
 40312	
 40313	The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain
 40314	sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper
 40315	of the shanty who didn't seem to.
 40316	
 40317	--Yes, that's the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of
 40318	that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.
 40319	
 40320	All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B's) busy brain,
 40321	education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,
 40322	up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed
 40323	with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian
 40324	with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other
 40325	things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the
 40326	housetops about it, and a slice of luck. An opening was all was wanted.
 40327	Because he more than suspected he had his father's voice to bank his
 40328	hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as
 40329	well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of
 40330	that particular red herring just to.
 40331	
 40332	The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former
 40333	viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers' association
 40334	dinner in London somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this
 40335	thrilling announcement. Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared
 40336	to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell
 40337	had left Euston for the chief secretary's lodge or words to that effect.
 40338	To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.
 40339	
 40340	--Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner
 40341	put in, manifesting some natural impatience.
 40342	
 40343	--And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.
 40344	
 40345	The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles
 40346	which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.
 40347	
 40348	--Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk
 40349	queried.
 40350	
 40351	--Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was
 40352	a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen
 40353	portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.
 40354	Sand in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the dark,
 40355	manner of speaking. _The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite
 40356	and _Red as a Rose is She._
 40357	
 40358	Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,
 40359	found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a
 40360	hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which
 40361	time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied
 40362	loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched
 40363	him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were
 40364	sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,
 40365	that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial
 40366	remark.
 40367	
 40368	To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first
 40369	to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first
 40370	and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for
 40371	the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine
 40372	host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were
 40373	not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a
 40374	grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in
 40375	four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously
 40376	spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him
 40377	in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well
 40378	worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.
 40379	
 40380	--Come, he counselled to close the _sÃ©ance_.
 40381	
 40382	Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the
 40383	shelter or shanty together and the _Ã©lite_ society of oilskin and
 40384	company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their
 40385	_dolce far niente_. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and
 40386	fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.
 40387	
 40388	--One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of
 40389	the moment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs
 40390	upside down, on the tables in cafes. To which impromptu the neverfailing
 40391	Bloom replied without a moment's hesitation, saying straight off:
 40392	
 40393	--To sweep the floor in the morning.
 40394	
 40395	So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same
 40396	time apologetic to get on his companion's right, a habit of his, by the
 40397	bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The
 40398	night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit
 40399	weak on his pins.
 40400	
 40401	--It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in
 40402	a moment. The only thing is to walk then you'll feel a different man.
 40403	Come. It's not far. Lean on me.
 40404	
 40405	Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen's right and led him on
 40406	accordingly.
 40407	
 40408	--Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange
 40409	kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and
 40410	all that.
 40411	
 40412	Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where
 40413	the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and
 40414	purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming
 40415	of fresh fields and pastures new. And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the
 40416	analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the
 40417	part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the
 40418	time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the
 40419	selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.
 40420	
 40421	So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which
 40422	Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made
 40423	tracks arm in arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though
 40424	confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to
 40425	follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante's _Huguenots_,
 40426	Meyerbeer's _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart's _Twelfth Mass_
 40427	he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme
 40428	of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into
 40429	a cocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic
 40430	church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as
 40431	those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and i will live
 40432	thy protestant to be_. He also yielded to none in his admiration of
 40433	Rossini's _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers,
 40434	in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable
 40435	sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laureis and
 40436	putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers' church
 40437	in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the
 40438	doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather. There was the
 40439	unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it
 40440	to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was
 40441	a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole though favouring
 40442	preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_,
 40443	a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface
 40444	knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And
 40445	talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old
 40446	favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel's air in _Martha,
 40447	M'appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be
 40448	more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the
 40449	lips of Stephen's respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the
 40450	number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in
 40451	reply to a politely put query, said he didn't sing it but launched
 40452	out into praises of Shakespeare's songs, at least of in or about that
 40453	period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the
 40454	herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was
 40455	contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B. did not quite
 40456	recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas
 40457	and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd
 40458	(William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen's chapel or
 40459	anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and
 40460	John Bull.
 40461	
 40462	On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond
 40463	the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,
 40464	brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not
 40465	perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive
 40466	guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political
 40467	celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a
 40468	striking coincidence.
 40469	
 40470	By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom,
 40471	who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other's sleeve
 40472	gently, jocosely remarking:
 40473	
 40474	--Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.
 40475	
 40476	They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth
 40477	anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite
 40478	near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh
 40479	because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a
 40480	taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the
 40481	lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such
 40482	a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn't a lump of sugar but, as he
 40483	wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency
 40484	that might crop up. He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a
 40485	horse, without a second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected,
 40486	take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan's, of the same size, would be a holy
 40487	horror to face. But it was no animal's fault in particular if he was
 40488	built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes
 40489	into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or
 40490	trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. Whale with a
 40491	harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the
 40492	joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. These timely
 40493	reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat
 40494	distracted from Stephen's words while the ship of the street was
 40495	manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.
 40496	
 40497	--What's this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging
 40498	_in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your
 40499	acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.
 40500	
 40501	He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,
 40502	image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome
 40503	blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as
 40504	he was perhaps not that way built.
 40505	
 40506	Still, supposing he had his father's gift as he more than suspected,
 40507	it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall's Irish
 40508	industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.
 40509	
 40510	Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has
 40511	End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows
 40512	come from. Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_
 40513	about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men,
 40514	which boggled Bloom a bit:
 40515	
 40516	     _Von der Sirenen Listigkeit
 40517	     Tun die Poeten dichten._
 40518	
 40519	These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_. Bloom, nodding,
 40520	said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which
 40521	he did.
 40522	
 40523	A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,
 40524	which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily,
 40525	if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production
 40526	such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain,
 40527	command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for
 40528	its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrÃ©e_ into fashionable
 40529	houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large
 40530	way of business and titled people where with his university degree of
 40531	B. A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more
 40532	influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct
 40533	success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the
 40534	purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended
 40535	to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a
 40536	youthful tyro in--society's sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a
 40537	little thing like that could militate against you. It was in fact only a
 40538	matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their
 40539	musical and artistic _conversaziones_ during the festivities of the
 40540	Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes
 40541	of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation,
 40542	cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record--in fact, without
 40543	giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could
 40544	easily have. Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument
 40545	by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition
 40546	fees. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need
 40547	necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy
 40548	space of time. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or
 40549	nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his
 40550	dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to
 40551	be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.
 40552	Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original
 40553	music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly
 40554	have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin's musical
 40555	world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a
 40556	confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus
 40557	omne_. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in
 40558	his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win
 40559	a high place in the city's esteem where he could command a stiff figure
 40560	and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King
 40561	street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him
 40562	upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the
 40563	goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often
 40564	tripped-up a too much fÃªted prince of good fellows. And it need not
 40565	detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would
 40566	have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when
 40567	desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or
 40568	containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself
 40569	alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason
 40570	why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat
 40571	of any sort, hung on to him at all.
 40572	
 40573	The horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he
 40574	purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on
 40575	the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his
 40576	connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was
 40577	prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious
 40578	pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it
 40579	which in Bloom's humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of
 40580	a person's character, no pun intended.
 40581	
 40582	The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and,
 40583	rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on
 40584	the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking
 40585	globes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full
 40586	crupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had
 40587	ended, patient in his scythed car.
 40588	
 40589	Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed
 40590	through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping
 40591	over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower,
 40592	Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.
 40593	
 40594	_Und alle Schiffe brÃ¼cken._
 40595	
 40596	The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely
 40597	watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black,
 40598	one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by
 40599	Father Maher_. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again
 40600	continuing their _tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte_ (which, of course, he was utterly out
 40601	of) about sirens enemies of man's reason, mingled with a number of other
 40602	topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind
 40603	while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the
 40604	sleeper car who in any case couldn't possibly hear because they were too
 40605	far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and
 40606	looked after their lowbacked car_.
 40607	
 40608	
 40609	
 40610	What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?
 40611	
 40612	Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they
 40613	followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and
 40614	Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,
 40615	Gardiner's place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of
 40616	Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing
 40617	right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching,
 40618	disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before
 40619	George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than
 40620	the arc which it subtends.
 40621	
 40622	
 40623	Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?
 40624	
 40625	Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,
 40626	prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and
 40627	glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed
 40628	corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,
 40629	ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers,
 40630	the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the
 40631	presabbath, Stephen's collapse.
 40632	
 40633	Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective
 40634	like and unlike reactions to experience?
 40635	
 40636	Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to
 40637	plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner
 40638	of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both
 40639	indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of
 40640	heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox
 40641	religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted
 40642	the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual
 40643	magnetism.
 40644	
 40645	
 40646	Were their views on some points divergent?
 40647	
 40648	Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's views on the importance of dietary
 40649	and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views
 40650	on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom
 40651	assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism
 40652	involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to
 40653	christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,
 40654	son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of
 40655	Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (died
 40656	266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty
 40657	and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to
 40658	gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of
 40659	adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and
 40660	the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen
 40661	attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both
 40662	from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first
 40663	no bigger than a woman's hand.
 40664	
 40665	
 40666	Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?
 40667	
 40668	The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining
 40669	paraheliotropic trees.
 40670	
 40671	
 40672	Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in
 40673	the past?
 40674	
 40675	In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public
 40676	thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's
 40677	corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.
 40678	
 40679	In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall
 40680	between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony
 40681	of Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and
 40682	prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class
 40683	railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian
 40684	Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on
 40685	the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once
 40686	in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour
 40687	of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west.
 40688	
 40689	
 40690	What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,
 40691	1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at
 40692	their destination?
 40693	
 40694	He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual
 40695	development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction
 40696	of the converse domain of interindividual relations.
 40697	
 40698	
 40699	As in what ways?
 40700	
 40701	From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:
 40702	existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence
 40703	to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.
 40704	
 40705	What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?
 40706	
 40707	At the housesteps of the 4th Of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number
 40708	7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket
 40709	of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.
 40710	
 40711	
 40712	Was it there?
 40713	
 40714	It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on
 40715	the day but one preceding.
 40716	
 40717	
 40718	Why was he doubly irritated?
 40719	
 40720	Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded
 40721	himself twice not to forget.
 40722	
 40723	
 40724	What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly
 40725	(respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?
 40726	
 40727	To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.
 40728	
 40729	
 40730	Bloom's decision?
 40731	
 40732	A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the
 40733	area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
 40734	the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its
 40735	length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches
 40736	of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by
 40737	separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for
 40738	the impact of the fall.
 40739	
 40740	
 40741	Did he fall?
 40742	
 40743	By his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in
 40744	avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for
 40745	periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman,
 40746	pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast
 40747	of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year
 40748	one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five
 40749	thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three
 40750	hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9,
 40751	dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.
 40752	
 40753	
 40754	Did he rise uninjured by concussion?
 40755	
 40756	Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by
 40757	the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force
 40758	at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied
 40759	at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the
 40760	subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free
 40761	inflammable coal gas by turningon the ventcock, lit a high flame which,
 40762	by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a
 40763	portable candle.
 40764	
 40765	
 40766	What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?
 40767	
 40768	Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
 40769	kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a
 40770	candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man
 40771	leaving the kitchen holding a candle.
 40772	
 40773	
 40774	Did the man reappear elsewhere?
 40775	
 40776	After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
 40777	through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the
 40778	halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space
 40779	of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.
 40780	
 40781	
 40782	Did Stephen obey his sign?
 40783	
 40784	Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed
 40785	softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted
 40786	candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down
 40787	a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's
 40788	house.
 40789	
 40790	
 40791	What did Bloom do?
 40792	
 40793	He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its
 40794	flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for
 40795	Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when
 40796	necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid
 40797	resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons
 40798	of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs
 40799	Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three projecting
 40800	points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing
 40801	the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and
 40802	hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.
 40803	
 40804	
 40805	Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?
 40806	
 40807	Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,
 40808	had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the
 40809	college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the
 40810	county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room
 40811	of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street:
 40812	of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss
 40813	Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie
 40814	(Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil
 40815	street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of
 40816	number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of
 40817	Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the
 40818	physics' theatre of university College, 16 Stephen's Green, north: of
 40819	his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's house in Cabra.
 40820	
 40821	
 40822	What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from
 40823	the fire towards the opposite wall?
 40824	
 40825	Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,
 40826	stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the
 40827	chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs
 40828	folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of
 40829	ladies' grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual
 40830	position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer
 40831	extremities and the third at their point of junction.
 40832	
 40833	
 40834	What did Bloom see on the range?
 40835	
 40836	On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left
 40837	(larger) hob a black iron kettle.
 40838	
 40839	
 40840	What did Bloom do at the range?
 40841	
 40842	He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron
 40843	kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to
 40844	let it flow.
 40845	
 40846	
 40847	Did it flow?
 40848	
 40849	Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of
 40850	2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of
 40851	filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial
 40852	plant cost of 5 pounds per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown,
 40853	Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan,
 40854	a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of
 40855	relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at
 40856	Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth
 40857	and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below
 40858	the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and
 40859	waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C. E., on the instructions of
 40860	the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for
 40861	purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of
 40862	recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals
 40863	as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding
 40864	their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch
 40865	meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by
 40866	a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of
 40867	the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the
 40868	detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers,
 40869	solvent, sound.
 40870	
 40871	What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,
 40872	returning to the range, admire?
 40873	
 40874	Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
 40875	in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's
 40876	projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific
 40877	exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface
 40878	particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence
 40879	of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic
 40880	quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides:
 40881	its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar
 40882	icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance:
 40883	its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its
 40884	indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region
 40885	below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability
 40886	of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve
 40887	and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of
 40888	tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and
 40889	islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas
 40890	and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and
 40891	volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns:
 40892	its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones:
 40893	its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and
 40894	confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic
 40895	currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence
 40896	in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
 40897	freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
 40898	cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
 40899	its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and
 40900	latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments
 40901	and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown
 40902	gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its
 40903	composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part
 40904	of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead
 40905	Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate
 40906	dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst
 40907	and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and
 40908	paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow,
 40909	hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs
 40910	and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and
 40911	archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and
 40912	arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility
 40913	in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power
 40914	stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals,
 40915	rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality
 40916	derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level
 40917	to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe),
 40918	numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its
 40919	ubiquity as constituting 90 percent of the human body: the noxiousness
 40920	of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded
 40921	flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.
 40922	
 40923	
 40924	Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he
 40925	return to the stillflowing tap?
 40926	
 40927	To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of
 40928	Barrington's lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought
 40929	thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh
 40930	cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a
 40931	long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.
 40932	
 40933	
 40934	What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer?
 40935	
 40936	That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by
 40937	submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month
 40938	of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of
 40939	glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.
 40940	
 40941	
 40942	What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and
 40943	prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a
 40944	preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with
 40945	rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region
 40946	in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most
 40947	sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?
 40948	
 40949	The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.
 40950	
 40951	
 40952	What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?
 40953	
 40954	Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric
 40955	energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the
 40956	lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.
 40957	
 40958	
 40959	Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?
 40960	
 40961	Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and
 40962	recuperation.
 40963	
 40964	
 40965	What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the
 40966	agency of fire?
 40967	
 40968	The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of
 40969	ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was
 40970	communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral
 40971	masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the
 40972	foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn
 40973	derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat
 40974	(radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous
 40975	ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such
 40976	combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source
 40977	of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated
 40978	through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part
 40979	reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising
 40980	the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in
 40981	temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal
 40982	units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50 degrees to 212 degrees
 40983	Fahrenheit.
 40984	
 40985	
 40986	What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?
 40987	
 40988	A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at
 40989	both sides simultaneously.
 40990	
 40991	
 40992	For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?
 40993	
 40994	To shave himself.
 40995	
 40996	
 40997	What advantages attended shaving by night?
 40998	
 40999	A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from
 41000	shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly
 41001	encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours:
 41002	quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when
 41003	awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and
 41004	perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper
 41005	read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a
 41006	shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might
 41007	cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with
 41008	precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.
 41009	
 41010	
 41011	Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?
 41012	
 41013	Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine
 41014	feminine passive active hand.
 41015	
 41016	
 41017	What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting
 41018	influence?
 41019	
 41020	The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human
 41021	blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their
 41022	natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic
 41023	surgery.
 41024	
 41025	
 41026	What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the
 41027	kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?
 41028	
 41029	On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal
 41030	breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a
 41031	moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white
 41032	goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly
 41033	copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits. On the middle shelf
 41034	a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four
 41035	conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of
 41036	Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and
 41037	containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and
 41038	Co's white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue
 41039	paper, a packet of Epps's soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch's
 41040	choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical
 41041	canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one,
 41042	the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with
 41043	augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy's cream,
 41044	a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of soured
 41045	adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and
 41046	semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr
 41047	Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts, made one imperial pint, the total
 41048	quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish
 41049	containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of
 41050	jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.
 41051	
 41052	
 41053	What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?
 41054	
 41055	Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets,
 41056	numbered 8 87, 88 6.
 41057	
 41058	
 41059	What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?
 41060	
 41061	Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction,
 41062	preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official
 41063	and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_,
 41064	late pink edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge.
 41065	
 41066	
 41067	Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected,
 41068	been received by him?
 41069	
 41070	In Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain
 41071	street: in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O'Connell
 41072	street lower, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in
 41073	his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah,
 41074	restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of
 41075	F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick
 41076	M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and
 41077	restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman's Journal and
 41078	National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently
 41079	thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of
 41080	the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of
 41081	inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the
 41082	secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.
 41083	
 41084	What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?
 41085	
 41086	The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event
 41087	followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the
 41088	electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss
 41089	by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding
 41090	originally from a successful interpretation.
 41091	
 41092	
 41093	His mood?
 41094	
 41095	He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he
 41096	was satisfied.
 41097	
 41098	
 41099	What satisfied him?
 41100	
 41101	To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to
 41102	others. Light to the gentiles.
 41103	
 41104	
 41105	How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?
 41106	
 41107	He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's
 41108	soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed
 41109	on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the
 41110	prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity
 41111	prescribed.
 41112	
 41113	
 41114	What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his
 41115	guest?
 41116	
 41117	Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation
 41118	Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly),
 41119	he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served
 41120	extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the
 41121	viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion
 41122	(Molly).
 41123	
 41124	
 41125	Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of
 41126	hospitality?
 41127	
 41128	His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted
 41129	them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct,
 41130	the creature cocoa.
 41131	
 41132	
 41133	Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,
 41134	reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to
 41135	complete the act begun?
 41136	
 41137	The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right
 41138	side of his guest's jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four
 41139	lady's handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable
 41140	condition.
 41141	
 41142	
 41143	Who drank more quickly?
 41144	
 41145	Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking,
 41146	from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady
 41147	flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to
 41148	two, nine to three.
 41149	
 41150	
 41151	What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?
 41152	
 41153	Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was
 41154	engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from
 41155	literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had
 41156	applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the
 41157	solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.
 41158	
 41159	
 41160	Had he found their solution?
 41161	
 41162	In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,
 41163	aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text,
 41164	the answers not bearing in all points.
 41165	
 41166	
 41167	What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,
 41168	potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering
 41169	of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for competition by the
 41170	_Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?
 41171	
 41172	     _An ambition to squint
 41173	     At my verses in print
 41174	     Makes me hope that for these you'll find room?.
 41175	     If you so condescend
 41176	     Then please place at the end
 41177	     The name of yours truly, L. Bloom._
 41178	
 41179	Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?
 41180	
 41181	Name, age, race, creed.
 41182	
 41183	
 41184	What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?
 41185	
 41186	     Leopold Bloom
 41187	     Ellpodbomool
 41188	     Molldopeloob
 41189	     Bollopedoom
 41190	     Old Ollebo, M. P.
 41191	
 41192	
 41193	What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic
 41194	poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?
 41195	
 41196	     _Poets oft have sung in rhyme
 41197	     Of music sweet their praise divine.
 41198	     Let them hymn it nine times nine.
 41199	     Dearer far than song or wine.
 41200	     You are mine. The world is mine._
 41201	
 41202	
 41203	What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G.
 41204	Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years,
 41205	entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_,
 41206	commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48,
 41207	49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the
 41208	valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand
 41209	annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R Shelton
 41210	26 December 1892, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George
 41211	A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under
 41212	the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir,
 41213	harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal
 41214	girl?
 41215	
 41216	Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest,
 41217	the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded
 41218	1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market:
 41219	secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the
 41220	questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the
 41221	duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru
 41222	(imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and
 41223	professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand
 41224	Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street:
 41225	fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist's
 41226	non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance
 41227	and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist's revelations of white
 41228	articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing
 41229	while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the
 41230	difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous
 41231	allusions from _Everybody's Book of Jokes_ (1000 pages and a laugh in
 41232	every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated
 41233	with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high
 41234	sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket
 41235	Barton.
 41236	
 41237	
 41238	What relation existed between their ages?
 41239	
 41240	16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen
 41241	was 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present
 41242	age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54
 41243	their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
 41244	1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according
 41245	as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in
 41246	1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then
 41247	1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen
 41248	would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
 41249	Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom,
 41250	being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have
 41251	surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah,
 41252	969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would
 41253	attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to
 41254	have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in
 41255	the year 81,396 B.C.
 41256	
 41257	
 41258	What events might nullify these calculations?
 41259	
 41260	The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a
 41261	new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent
 41262	extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.
 41263	
 41264	
 41265	How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?
 41266	
 41267	Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina
 41268	Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's
 41269	mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his
 41270	hand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a
 41271	rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father
 41272	and Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.
 41273	
 41274	
 41275	Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and
 41276	afterwards seconded by the father?
 41277	
 41278	Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative
 41279	gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.
 41280	
 41281	
 41282	Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a
 41283	third connecting link between them?
 41284	
 41285	Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the
 41286	house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and
 41287	had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms
 41288	Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during parts
 41289	of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of Bloom
 41290	who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the
 41291	employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of
 41292	sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.
 41293	
 41294	
 41295	Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?
 41296	
 41297	He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow
 41298	of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair
 41299	with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North
 41300	Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had
 41301	remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular
 41302	fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles
 41303	equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems,
 41304	private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from
 41305	the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa.
 41306	
 41307	
 41308	Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?
 41309	
 41310	Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel
 41311	of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with
 41312	continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,
 41313	velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round
 41314	and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.
 41315	
 41316	
 41317	What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years
 41318	deceased?
 41319	
 41320	The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her
 41321	suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient
 41322	catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue
 41323	of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles
 41324	Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.
 41325	
 41326	
 41327	Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation
 41328	which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the
 41329	more desirable?
 41330	
 41331	The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently
 41332	abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's _Physical Strength and How to
 41333	Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in
 41334	sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in
 41335	front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of
 41336	muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant
 41337	relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.
 41338	
 41339	
 41340	Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?
 41341	
 41342	Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full
 41343	circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he
 41344	had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever
 41345	movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed
 41346	abdominal muscles.
 41347	
 41348	
 41349	Did either openly allude to their racial difference?
 41350	
 41351	Neither.
 41352	
 41353	
 41354	What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts
 41355	about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen's thoughts about
 41356	Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?
 41357	
 41358	He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he
 41359	knew that he knew that he was not.
 41360	
 41361	
 41362	What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective
 41363	parentages?
 41364	
 41365	Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently
 41366	Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and
 41367	Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born
 41368	Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). Stephen, eldest surviving male
 41369	consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary,
 41370	daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).
 41371	
 41372	
 41373	Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or
 41374	layman?
 41375	
 41376	Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A., alone,
 41377	in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James
 41378	O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump
 41379	in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in
 41380	the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend
 41381	Charles Malone C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons,
 41382	Rathgar.
 41383	
 41384	
 41385	Did they find their educational careers similar?
 41386	
 41387	Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively
 41388	through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for
 41389	Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory,
 41390	junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the
 41391	matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the
 41392	royal university.
 41393	
 41394	
 41395	Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university
 41396	of life?
 41397	
 41398	Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation
 41399	had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.
 41400	
 41401	
 41402	What two temperaments did they individually represent?
 41403	
 41404	The scientific. The artistic.
 41405	
 41406	
 41407	What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards
 41408	applied, rather than towards pure, science?
 41409	
 41410	Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining
 41411	in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his
 41412	appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once
 41413	revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting
 41414	telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water
 41415	siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.
 41416	
 41417	
 41418	Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of
 41419	kindergarten?
 41420	
 41421	Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,
 41422	catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the
 41423	twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature
 41424	mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical
 41425	to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls,
 41426	historically costumed dolls.
 41427	
 41428	
 41429	What also stimulated him in his cogitations?
 41430	
 41431	The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James,
 41432	the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George's street, south, the latter
 41433	at his 6 1/2d shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30
 41434	Henry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities
 41435	hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed
 41436	in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility
 41437	(divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of
 41438	magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to
 41439	convince, to decide.
 41440	
 41441	
 41442	Such as?
 41443	
 41444	K. II. Kino's 11/- Trousers. House of Keys. Alexander J. Keyes.
 41445	
 41446	
 41447	Such as not?
 41448	
 41449	Look at this long candle. Calculate when it burns out and you receive
 41450	gratis 1 pair of our special non-compo boots, guaranteed 1 candle power.
 41451	Address: Barclay and Cook, 18 Talbot street.
 41452	
 41453	Bacilikil (Insect Powder). Veribest (Boot Blacking). Uwantit (Combined
 41454	pocket twoblade penknife with corkscrew, nailfile and pipecleaner).
 41455	
 41456	
 41457	Such as never?
 41458	
 41459	What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat?
 41460	
 41461	Incomplete.
 41462	
 41463	With it an abode of bliss.
 41464	
 41465	Manufactured by George Plumtree, 23 Merchants' quay, Dublin, put up in
 41466	4 oz pots, and inserted by Councillor Joseph P. Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda
 41467	Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries
 41468	of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree in a meatpot,
 41469	registered trade mark. Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Moutpat.
 41470	Plamtroo.
 41471	
 41472	
 41473	Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that
 41474	originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably
 41475	conduce to success?
 41476	
 41477	His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn
 41478	by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be
 41479	seated engaged in writing.
 41480	
 41481	
 41482	What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?
 41483	
 41484	Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark
 41485	corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She
 41486	sits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks.
 41487	On solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs.
 41488	Wheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He
 41489	seizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads.
 41490	Solitary.
 41491	
 41492	
 41493	What?
 41494	
 41495	In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen's Hotel, Queen's Hotel, Queen's
 41496	Hotel. Queen's Ho...
 41497	
 41498	
 41499	What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?
 41500	
 41501	The Queen's Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf
 41502	Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated,
 41503	in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in
 41504	the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment
 41505	to I of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the
 41506	morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17
 41507	Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having,
 41508	purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater
 41509	straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of
 41510	having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin
 41511	aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street,
 41512	Ennis.
 41513	
 41514	
 41515	Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or
 41516	intuition?
 41517	
 41518	Coincidence.
 41519	
 41520	
 41521	Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?
 41522	
 41523	He preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's
 41524	words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament
 41525	relieved.
 41526	
 41527	
 41528	Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to
 41529	him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The
 41530	Parable of the Plums_?
 41531	
 41532	It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by
 41533	implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms
 41534	(e.g. _My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time_)
 41535	composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and
 41536	in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of
 41537	financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially
 41538	collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent
 41539	merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or
 41540	contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy
 41541	or Doctor Dick or Heblon's _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of
 41542	certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual
 41543	stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful
 41544	narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during
 41545	the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice
 41546	on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius
 41547	Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.
 41548	
 41549	
 41550	Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other
 41551	frequently engaged his mind?
 41552	
 41553	What to do with our wives.
 41554	
 41555	
 41556	What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?
 41557	
 41558	Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball,
 41559	nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts,
 41560	chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the
 41561	policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano
 41562	and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing:
 41563	biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as
 41564	pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in
 41565	a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of
 41566	erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically
 41567	controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals
 41568	and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female
 41569	acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of
 41570	evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction
 41571	agreeable.
 41572	
 41573	
 41574	What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him
 41575	in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?
 41576	
 41577	In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper
 41578	with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and
 41579	Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals
 41580	as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of
 41581	a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political
 41582	complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating
 41583	the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.
 41584	After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned
 41585	the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to
 41586	the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual
 41587	polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false
 41588	analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a
 41589	mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).
 41590	
 41591	
 41592	What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and
 41593	such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?
 41594	
 41595	The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all
 41596	balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her
 41597	proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.
 41598	
 41599	
 41600	How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?
 41601	
 41602	Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a
 41603	certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent
 41604	knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's
 41605	ignorant lapse.
 41606	
 41607	
 41608	With what success had he attempted direct instruction?
 41609	
 41610	She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest
 41611	comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty
 41612	remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated
 41613	with error.
 41614	
 41615	
 41616	What system had proved more effective?
 41617	
 41618	Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.
 41619	
 41620	
 41621	Example?
 41622	
 41623	She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she
 41624	disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new
 41625	hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.
 41626	
 41627	
 41628	Accepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of
 41629	postexilic eminence did he adduce?
 41630	
 41631	Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides,
 41632	author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn
 41633	of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there
 41634	arose none like Moses (Maimonides).
 41635	
 41636	
 41637	What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth
 41638	seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by
 41639	Stephen?
 41640	
 41641	That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,
 41642	name uncertain.
 41643	
 41644	
 41645	Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a
 41646	selected or rejected race mentioned?
 41647	
 41648	Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),
 41649	Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).
 41650	
 41651	
 41652	What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish
 41653	languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts
 41654	by guest to host and by host to guest?
 41655	
 41656	By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_
 41657	(walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).
 41658	
 41659	
 41660	By Bloom: _Kkifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch_ (thy temple
 41661	amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).
 41662	
 41663	
 41664	How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages
 41665	made in substantiation of the oral comparison?
 41666	
 41667	By juxtaposition. On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior
 41668	literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so
 41669	manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of
 41670	the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish
 41671	characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn
 41672	wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of
 41673	mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal
 41674	and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.
 41675	
 41676	
 41677	Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the
 41678	extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?
 41679	
 41680	Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence
 41681	and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.
 41682	
 41683	
 41684	What points of contact existed between these languages and between the
 41685	peoples who spoke them?
 41686	
 41687	The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and
 41688	servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been
 41689	taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary
 41690	instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel,
 41691	and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their
 41692	archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic,
 41693	toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works
 41694	of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor,
 41695	Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth,
 41696	Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the
 41697	isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.
 41698	Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the proscription
 41699	of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the
 41700	restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish
 41701	political autonomy or devolution.
 41702	
 41703	
 41704	What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,
 41705	ethnically irreducible consummation?
 41706	
 41707	     _Kolod balejwaw pnimah
 41708	     Nefesch, jehudi, homijah._
 41709	
 41710	
 41711	Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?
 41712	
 41713	In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.
 41714	
 41715	
 41716	How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?
 41717	
 41718	By a periphrastic version of the general text.
 41719	
 41720	
 41721	In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?
 41722	
 41723	The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic
 41724	hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of
 41725	modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions
 41726	(Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic). Did
 41727	the guest comply with his host's request?
 41728	
 41729	Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.
 41730	
 41731	What was Stephen's auditive sensation?
 41732	
 41733	He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation
 41734	of the past.
 41735	
 41736	
 41737	What was Bloom's visual sensation?
 41738	
 41739	He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a
 41740	future.
 41741	
 41742	
 41743	What were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional
 41744	quasisensations of concealed identities?
 41745	
 41746	Visually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted
 41747	by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as
 41748	leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair. Auditively, Bloom's: The
 41749	traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.
 41750	
 41751	
 41752	What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with
 41753	what exemplars?
 41754	
 41755	In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very
 41756	reverend John Conmee S. J., the reverend T. Salmon, D. D., provost of
 41757	Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish:
 41758	exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K. C., Rufus Isaacs, K. C. On the stage modern
 41759	or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian Osmond
 41760	Tearle (died 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.
 41761	
 41762	
 41763	Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange
 41764	legend on an allied theme?
 41765	
 41766	Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being
 41767	secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid
 41768	residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream
 41769	plus cocoa, having been consumed.
 41770	
 41771	
 41772	Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.
 41773	
 41774	     _Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all
 41775	     Went out for to play ball.
 41776	     And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played
 41777	     He drove it o'er the jew's garden wall.
 41778	     And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played
 41779	     He broke the jew's windows all._
 41780	
 41781	
 41782	
 41783	How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?
 41784	
 41785	
 41786	With unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew he heard with pleasure and saw the
 41787	unbroken kitchen window.
 41788	
 41789	
 41790	Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.
 41791	
 41792	     _Then out there came the jew's daughter
 41793	     And she all dressed in green.
 41794	     "Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,
 41795	     And play your ball again."
 41796	
 41797	     "I can't come back and I won't come back
 41798	     Without my schoolfellows all.
 41799	     For if my master he did hear
 41800	     He'd make it a sorry ball."
 41801	
 41802	     She took him by the lilywhite hand
 41803	     And led him along the hall
 41804	     Until she led him to a room
 41805	     Where none could hear him call.
 41806	
 41807	     She took a penknife out of her pocket
 41808	     And cut off his little head.
 41809	     And now he'll play his ball no more
 41810	     For he lies among the dead._
 41811	
 41812	
 41813	How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?
 41814	
 41815	With mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's
 41816	daughter, all dressed in green.
 41817	
 41818	
 41819	Condense Stephen's commentary.
 41820	
 41821	One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by
 41822	inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he
 41823	is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope
 41824	and youth, holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation,
 41825	to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him,
 41826	consenting.
 41827	
 41828	
 41829	Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?
 41830	
 41831	He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him
 41832	should by him not be told.
 41833	
 41834	
 41835	Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?
 41836	
 41837	In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.
 41838	
 41839	
 41840	Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?
 41841	
 41842	He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
 41843	incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the
 41844	propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of
 41845	opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of
 41846	atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,
 41847	hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.
 41848	
 41849	
 41850	From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not
 41851	totally immune?
 41852	
 41853	From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his
 41854	sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an
 41855	indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From
 41856	somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and
 41857	crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained
 41858	its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,
 41859	sleeping.
 41860	
 41861	
 41862	Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member
 41863	of his family?
 41864	
 41865	Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent
 41866	(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation
 41867	of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night
 41868	attire with a vacant mute expression.
 41869	
 41870	
 41871	What other infantile memories had he of her?
 41872	
 41873	15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and
 41874	lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks
 41875	her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo,
 41876	tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark,
 41877	she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau,
 41878	Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British
 41879	navy.
 41880	
 41881	
 41882	What endemic characteristics were present?
 41883	
 41884	Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct
 41885	line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant
 41886	intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.
 41887	
 41888	
 41889	What memories had he of her adolescence?
 41890	
 41891	She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn,
 41892	entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and
 41893	take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South
 41894	Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual
 41895	of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned
 41896	abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th
 41897	anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county
 41898	Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year
 41899	not stated).
 41900	
 41901	
 41902	Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?
 41903	
 41904	Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.
 41905	
 41906	
 41907	What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,
 41908	if differently?
 41909	
 41910	A temporary departure of his cat.
 41911	
 41912	
 41913	Why similarly, why differently?
 41914	
 41915	Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male
 41916	
 41917	(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently,
 41918	because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the
 41919	habitation.
 41920	
 41921	
 41922	In other respects were their differences similar?
 41923	
 41924	In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in
 41925	unexpectedness.
 41926	
 41927	
 41928	As?
 41929	
 41930	Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it
 41931	for her (cf neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake
 41932	in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented
 41933	spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the
 41934	constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf
 41935	mousewatching cat).
 41936	
 41937	Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences
 41938	of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf
 41939	earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had
 41940	an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been
 41941	Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which
 41942	it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat). Hence, in
 41943	passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness,
 41944	their differences were similar.
 41945	
 41946	
 41947	In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, (2) a clock, given as
 41948	matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?
 41949	
 41950	As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous
 41951	animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of
 41952	vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the
 41953	pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation
 41954	in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of
 41955	clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the
 41956	recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the
 41957	shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, 5
 41958	5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.
 41959	
 41960	
 41961	In what manners did she reciprocate?
 41962	
 41963	She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to
 41964	him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.
 41965	She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases
 41966	had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his
 41967	necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon
 41968	having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire
 41969	to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the
 41970	moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.
 41971	
 41972	
 41973	What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make
 41974	to Stephen, noctambulist?
 41975	
 41976	To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and
 41977	Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately
 41978	above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of
 41979	his host and hostess.
 41980	
 41981	
 41982	What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation
 41983	of such an extemporisation?
 41984	
 41985	For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the
 41986	host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the
 41987	hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian
 41988	pronunciation.
 41989	
 41990	
 41991	Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and
 41992	a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
 41993	eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's
 41994	daughter?
 41995	
 41996	Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother
 41997	through daughter.
 41998	
 41999	
 42000	To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest
 42001	return a monosyllabic negative answer?
 42002	
 42003	If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney
 42004	Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.
 42005	
 42006	
 42007	What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the
 42008	host?
 42009	
 42010	A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment
 42011	of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the
 42012	anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).
 42013	
 42014	
 42015	Was the proposal of asylum accepted?
 42016	
 42017	Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.
 42018	What exchange of money took place between host and guest?
 42019	
 42020	The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money
 42021	(1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to
 42022	the former.
 42023	
 42024	
 42025	What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,
 42026	declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?
 42027	
 42028	To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place
 42029	the residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal
 42030	instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate
 42031	a series of static semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues,
 42032	places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in
 42033	the same place), the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and
 42034	E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare
 42035	street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a
 42036	public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two
 42037	or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line
 42038	drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in
 42039	different places).
 42040	
 42041	
 42042	What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually
 42043	selfexcluding propositions?
 42044	
 42045	The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert
 42046	Hengler's circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive
 42047	particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring
 42048	to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had
 42049	publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his
 42050	(the clown's) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the
 42051	summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches
 42052	on the milled edge and tendered it m payment of an account due to and
 42053	received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand
 42054	Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible,
 42055	circuitous or direct, return.
 42056	
 42057	
 42058	Was the clown Bloom's son?
 42059	
 42060	No.
 42061	
 42062	
 42063	Had Bloom's coin returned?
 42064	
 42065	Never.
 42066	
 42067	
 42068	Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?
 42069	
 42070	Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to
 42071	amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and
 42072	international animosity. He believed then that human life was infinitely
 42073	perfectible, eliminating these conditions?
 42074	
 42075	There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct
 42076	from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of
 42077	destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of
 42078	the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and
 42079	death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human
 42080	females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable
 42081	accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies
 42082	and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital
 42083	criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make
 42084	terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres
 42085	of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital
 42086	growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through
 42087	maturity to decay.
 42088	
 42089	
 42090	Why did he desist from speculation?
 42091	
 42092	Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other
 42093	more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena
 42094	to be removed.
 42095	
 42096	
 42097	Did Stephen participate in his dejection?
 42098	
 42099	He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding
 42100	syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational
 42101	reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the
 42102	incertitude of the void.
 42103	
 42104	
 42105	Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?
 42106	
 42107	Not verbally. Substantially.
 42108	
 42109	
 42110	What comforted his misapprehension?
 42111	
 42112	That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from
 42113	the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.
 42114	
 42115	
 42116	In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus
 42117	from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?
 42118	
 42119	Lighted Candle in Stick borne by
 42120	
 42121	BLOOM
 42122	
 42123	Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by
 42124	
 42125	STEPHEN:
 42126	
 42127	
 42128	With what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm?
 42129	
 42130	The 113th, _modus peregrinus: In exitu Israel de Egypto: domus Jacob de
 42131	populo barbaro_.
 42132	
 42133	
 42134	What did each do at the door of egress?
 42135	
 42136	Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.
 42137	
 42138	
 42139	For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?
 42140	
 42141	For a cat.
 42142	
 42143	
 42144	What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the
 42145	guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from
 42146	the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?
 42147	
 42148	The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.
 42149	
 42150	
 42151	With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his
 42152	companion of various constellations?
 42153	
 42154	Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in
 42155	incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous
 42156	scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an
 42157	observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000
 42158	ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius
 42159	(alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant
 42160	and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the
 42161	precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and
 42162	nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund
 42163	and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging
 42164	towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic
 42165	drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from
 42166	immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with
 42167	which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a
 42168	parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.
 42169	
 42170	
 42171	Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?
 42172	
 42173	Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the
 42174	earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed
 42175	in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds,
 42176	of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable
 42177	trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained
 42178	by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe
 42179	of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves
 42180	universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in
 42181	continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was
 42182	again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends
 42183	and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the
 42184	progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.
 42185	
 42186	
 42187	Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?
 42188	
 42189	Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem
 42190	of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a
 42191	number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude
 42192	and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that,
 42193	the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000
 42194	pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to
 42195	be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed
 42196	integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands,
 42197	hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions,
 42198	billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series
 42199	containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost
 42200	kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.
 42201	
 42202	
 42203	Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their
 42204	satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and
 42205	moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?
 42206	
 42207	Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism,
 42208	normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons,
 42209	when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere
 42210	suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as
 42211	the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was
 42212	approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo,
 42213	when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a
 42214	working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more
 42215	adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might
 42216	subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian,
 42217	Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though
 42218	an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite
 42219	differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would
 42220	probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to
 42221	vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.
 42222	
 42223	     And the problem of possible redemption?
 42224	     The minor was proved by the major.
 42225	
 42226	
 42227	Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?
 42228	
 42229	The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,
 42230	yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy:
 42231	their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions:
 42232	the waggoner's star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular
 42233	cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the
 42234	interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous
 42235	discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel,
 42236	Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes
 42237	of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite
 42238	compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive
 42239	and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of
 42240	meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth
 42241	of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers
 42242	about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, lo August): the
 42243	monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms:
 42244	the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a
 42245	star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and
 42246	day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in
 42247	incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the
 42248	birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting
 42249	constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar
 42250	origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared
 42251	from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period
 42252	of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar
 42253	origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared
 42254	from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of
 42255	Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years
 42256	after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from
 42257	other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of
 42258	other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar,
 42259	from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow,
 42260	taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular
 42261	animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters,
 42262	pallor of human beings.
 42263	
 42264	
 42265	His (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing
 42266	for possible error?
 42267	
 42268	That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not
 42269	a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from
 42270	the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the
 42271	suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of
 42272	different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space,
 42273	remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a
 42274	present before its probable spectators had entered actual present
 42275	existence.
 42276	
 42277	
 42278	Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?
 42279	
 42280	Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the
 42281	delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection
 42282	invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the
 42283	satellite of their planet.
 42284	
 42285	
 42286	Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological
 42287	influences upon sublunary disasters?
 42288	
 42289	It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the
 42290	nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to
 42291	verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the
 42292	sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.
 42293	
 42294	
 42295	What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and
 42296	woman?
 42297	
 42298	Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian
 42299	generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence:
 42300	her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising
 42301	and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced
 42302	invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative
 42303	interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power
 42304	to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to
 42305	incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her
 42306	visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent
 42307	propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her
 42308	light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her
 42309	arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction,
 42310	when invisible.
 42311	
 42312	
 42313	What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's,
 42314	gaze?
 42315	
 42316	In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a
 42317	paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller
 42318	blind supplied by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving
 42319	shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.
 42320	
 42321	
 42322	How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his
 42323	wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?
 42324	
 42325	With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued
 42326	affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with
 42327	suggestion.
 42328	
 42329	
 42330	Both then were silent?
 42331	
 42332	Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal
 42333	flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.
 42334	
 42335	
 42336	Were they indefinitely inactive?
 42337	
 42338	At Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen,
 42339	then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs
 42340	of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition,
 42341	their gazes, first Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to the projected
 42342	luminous and semiluminous shadow.
 42343	
 42344	
 42345	Similarly?
 42346	
 42347	The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations
 42348	were dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of
 42349	the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate
 42350	year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point
 42351	of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the
 42352	institution, 210 scholars: Stephen's higher, more sibilant, who in the
 42353	ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption
 42354	an insistent vesical pressure.
 42355	
 42356	
 42357	What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the
 42358	invisible audible collateral organ of the other?
 42359	
 42360	To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity,
 42361	reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.
 42362	
 42363	To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised
 42364	(I January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from
 42365	unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine
 42366	prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic
 42367	church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of
 42368	the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine
 42369	excrescences as hair and toenails.
 42370	
 42371	
 42372	What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?
 42373	
 42374	A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament
 42375	from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress
 42376	of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.
 42377	
 42378	
 42379	How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal
 42380	departer?
 42381	
 42382	By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an
 42383	unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and
 42384	turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its
 42385	staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and
 42386	revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.
 42387	
 42388	
 42389	How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?
 42390	
 42391	Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its
 42392	base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and
 42393	forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.
 42394	
 42395	
 42396	What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their
 42397	(respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?
 42398	
 42399	The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells
 42400	in the church of Saint George.
 42401	
 42402	
 42403	What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?
 42404	
 42405	By Stephen:
 42406	
 42407	_Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet. Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus
 42408	excipiat._
 42409	
 42410	By Bloom:
 42411	
 42412	     _Heigho, heigho,
 42413	     Heigho, heigho._
 42414	
 42415	
 42416	Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day
 42417	at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south
 42418	to Glasnevin in the north?
 42419	
 42420	Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed),
 42421	Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John
 42422	Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed),
 42423	Paddy Dignam (in the grave).
 42424	
 42425	
 42426	Alone, what did Bloom hear?
 42427	
 42428	The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the
 42429	double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane.
 42430	
 42431	
 42432	Alone, what did Bloom feel?
 42433	
 42434	The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing
 42435	point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Reaumur: the
 42436	incipient intimations of proximate dawn.
 42437	
 42438	
 42439	Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind
 42440	him?
 42441	
 42442	Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy
 42443	Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis,
 42444	Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin
 42445	Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis,
 42446	Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).
 42447	
 42448	
 42449	What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?
 42450	
 42451	The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the
 42452	apparition of a new solar disk.
 42453	
 42454	
 42455	Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?
 42456	
 42457	Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house
 42458	of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition
 42459	of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the
 42460	direction of Mizrach, the east.
 42461	
 42462	
 42463	He remembered the initial paraphenomena?
 42464	
 42465	More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at
 42466	various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer,
 42467	the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the
 42468	first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.
 42469	
 42470	
 42471	Did he remain?
 42472	
 42473	With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering
 42474	the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the
 42475	candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room,
 42476	hallfloor, and reentered.
 42477	
 42478	
 42479	What suddenly arrested his ingress?
 42480	
 42481	The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into
 42482	contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible
 42483	fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in
 42484	consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.
 42485	
 42486	
 42487	Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of
 42488	furniture.
 42489	
 42490	A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
 42491	the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an
 42492	alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and
 42493	white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
 42494	door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
 42495	(a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had
 42496	been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
 42497	more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
 42498	from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied
 42499	by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.
 42500	
 42501	
 42502	Describe them.
 42503	
 42504	One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back
 42505	slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an
 42506	irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply
 42507	upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.
 42508	The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed
 42509	directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat
 42510	to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of
 42511	white plaited rush.
 42512	
 42513	
 42514	What significances attached to these two chairs?
 42515	
 42516	Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial
 42517	evidence, of testimonial supermanence.
 42518	
 42519	
 42520	What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?
 42521	
 42522	A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin
 42523	supporting a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray
 42524	containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two
 42525	discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in
 42526	the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love's Old Sweet Song_
 42527	(words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam
 42528	Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications
 42529	_ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_,
 42530	close.
 42531	
 42532	
 42533	With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?
 42534	
 42535	With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right
 42536	temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on
 42537	a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,
 42538	bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,
 42539	remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan's scheme of colour containing the
 42540	gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent
 42541	act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility
 42542	the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual
 42543	discolouration.
 42544	
 42545	
 42546	His next proceeding?
 42547	
 42548	From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black
 42549	diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on
 42550	a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the
 42551	mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus
 42552	(illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined
 42553	it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
 42554	candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the
 42555	latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin
 42556	of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to
 42557	facilitate total combustion.
 42558	
 42559	
 42560	What followed this operation?
 42561	
 42562	The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a
 42563	vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.
 42564	
 42565	
 42566	What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the
 42567	mantelpiece?
 42568	
 42569	A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46
 42570	a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf
 42571	tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial
 42572	gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of
 42573	Alderman John Hooper.
 42574	
 42575	
 42576	What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and
 42577	Bloom?
 42578	
 42579	In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
 42580	dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before
 42581	the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear
 42582	melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom
 42583	while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated
 42584	gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.
 42585	
 42586	
 42587	What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his
 42588	attention?
 42589	
 42590	The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.
 42591	
 42592	
 42593	Why solitary (ipsorelative)?
 42594	
 42595	_Brothers and sisters had he none. Yet that man's father was his
 42596	grandfather's son._
 42597	
 42598	
 42599	Why mutable (aliorelative)?
 42600	
 42601	From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.
 42602	From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal
 42603	procreator.
 42604	
 42605	
 42606	What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?
 42607	
 42608	The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged
 42609	and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles
 42610	on the two bookshelves opposite.
 42611	
 42612

 42677	
 42678	What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of
 42679	the inverted volumes?

 42682	place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females:
 42683	the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella

 42696	The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a
 42697	decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).
 42698	
 42699	
 42700	Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?
 42701	
 42702	Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an
 42703	interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to consult
 42704	the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the
 42705	military engagement, Plevna.
 42706	
 42707	
 42708	What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?
 42709	
 42710	The candour, nudity, pose, tranquility, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a
 42711	statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus purchased
 42712	by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk.
 42713	
 42714	
 42715	What caused him irritation in his sitting posture? Inhibitory pressure
 42716	of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two articles of clothing
 42717	superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations
 42718	of mass by expansion.
 42719	
 42720	
 42721	How was the irritation allayed?
 42722	
 42723	He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible
 42724	stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He
 42725	unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt
 42726	and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs
 42727	extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the
 42728	circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial
 42729	line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae,
 42730	thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles
 42731	described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits
 42732	of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus
 42733	one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.
 42734	
 42735	
 42736	What involuntary actions followed?
 42737	
 42738	He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in
 42739	the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting
 42740	inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee.
 42741	He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of
 42742	prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly
 42743	abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of
 42744	his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (I shilling),
 42745	placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the
 42746	interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.

 42817	Did the process of divestiture continue?
 42818	
 42819	Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended
 42820	his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient
 42821	points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in
 42822	several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots,
 42823	unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the
 42824	second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the
 42825	fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised
 42826	his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender,
 42827	took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin
 42828	of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding
 42829	part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and
 42830	inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the
 42831	lacerated ungual fragment.
 42832	
 42833	
 42834	Why with satisfaction?
 42835	
 42836	Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other
 42837	ungual fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs
 42838	Ellis's juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief
 42839	genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.
 42840	
 42841	
 42842	In what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions
 42843	now coalesced?
 42844	
 42845	Not to inherit by right of primogeniture, gavelkind or borough English,
 42846	or possess in perpetuity an extensive demesne of a sufficient number of
 42847	acres, roods and perches, statute land measure (valuation 42 pounds), of
 42848	grazing turbary surrounding a baronial hall with gatelodge and carriage
 42849	drive nor, on the other hand, a terracehouse or semidetached villa,
 42850	described as _Rus in Urbe_ or _Qui si sana_, but to purchase by private
 42851	treaty in fee simple a thatched bungalowshaped 2 storey dwellinghouse of
 42852	southerly aspect, surmounted by vane and lightning conductor, connected
 42853	with the earth, with porch covered by parasitic plants (ivy or Virginia
 42854	creeper), halldoor, olive green, with smart carriage finish and neat
 42855	doorbrasses, stucco front with gilt tracery at eaves and gable, rising,
 42856	if possible, upon a gentle eminence with agreeable prospect from balcony
 42857	with stone pillar parapet over unoccupied and unoccupyable interjacent
 42858	pastures and standing in 5 or 6 acres of its own ground, at such
 42859	a distance from the nearest public thoroughfare as to render its
 42860	houselights visible at night above and through a quickset hornbeam hedge
 42861	of topiary cutting, situate at a given point not less than 1 statute
 42862	mile from the periphery of the metropolis, within a time limit of not
 42863	more than 15 minutes from tram or train line (e.g., Dundrum, south, or
 42864	Sutton, north, both localities equally reported by trial to resemble the
 42865	terrestrial poles in being favourable climates for phthisical subjects),

 42881	oil and vinegar) and pyramidically prismatic central chandelier lustre,

 42899	
 42900	
 42901	What additional attractions might the grounds contain?
 42902	
 42903	As addenda, a tennis and fives court, a shrubbery, a glass summerhouse

 42926	(lady's and gentleman's), a sundial shaded and sheltered by laburnum
 42927	or lilac trees, an exotically harmonically accorded Japanese tinkle
 42928	gatebell affixed to left lateral gatepost, a capacious waterbutt,

 42930	hydraulic hose.
 42931	
 42932	
 42933	What facilities of transit were desirable?
 42934	
 42935	When citybound frequent connection by train or tram from their
 42936	respective intermediate station or terminal. When countrybound

 42940	
 42941	
 42942	What might be the name of this erigible or erected residence?
 42943	
 42944	Bloom Cottage. Saint Leopold's. Flowerville.
 42945	
 42946	
 42947	Could Bloom of 7 Eccles street foresee Bloom of Flowerville?

 42951	young firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling a
 42952	weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the scent
 42953	of newmown hay, ameliorating the soil, multiplying wisdom, achieving
 42954	longevity.
 42955	
 42956	
 42957	What syllabus of intellectual pursuits was simultaneously possible?
 42958	
 42959	Snapshot photography, comparative study of religions, folklore relative
 42960	to various amatory and superstitious practices, contemplation of the
 42961	celestial constellations.
 42962	
 42963	
 42964	What lighter recreations?
 42965	
 42966	Outdoor: garden and fieldwork, cycling on level macadamised causeways
 42967	ascents of moderately high hills, natation in secluded fresh water and
 42968	unmolested river boating in secure wherry or light curricle with kedge
 42969	anchor on reaches free from weirs and rapids (period of estivation),

 42974	unexpurgated exotic erotic masterpieces: house carpentry with toolbox
 42975	containing hammer, awl nails, screws, tintacks, gimlet, tweezers,
 42976	bullnose plane and turnscrew. Might he become a gentleman farmer of
 42977	field produce and live stock?
 42978	
 42979	Not impossibly, with 1 or 2 stripper cows, 1 pike of upland hay and
 42980	requisite farming implements, e.g., an end-to-end churn, a turnip pulper
 42981	etc.
 42982	
 42983	
 42984	What would be his civic functions and social status among the county
 42985	families and landed gentry?
 42986	
 42987	Arranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order, that
 42988	of gardener, groundsman, cultivator, breeder, and at the zenith of his
 42989	career, resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest
 42990	and coat of arms and appropriate classical motto _(Semper paratus_),
 42991	duly recorded in the court directory (Bloom, Leopold P., M. P., P. C.,
 42992	K. P., L. L. D. (_honoris causa_), Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned in
 42993	court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left
 42994	Kingstown for England).
 42995	
 42996	
 42997	What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?
 42998	
 42999	A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour:
 43000	the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes,
 43001	incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality,
 43002	of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants
 43003	of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing
 43004	with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown. Loyal to
 43005	the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of
 43006	rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order,
 43007	the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every
 43008	measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be
 43009	contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter
 43010	of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in
 43011	covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations,
 43012	all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of
 43013	venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators
 43014	of international persecution, all perpetuators of international
 43015	animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all
 43016	recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.
 43017	
 43018	
 43019	Prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.
 43020	
 43021	To Master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his
 43022	disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his
 43023	father Rudolf Virag (later Rudolph Bloom) had been converted from the
 43024	Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting
 43025	Christianity among the jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of
 43026	Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony
 43027	in 1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile
 43028	friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he
 43029	had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of
 43030	colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of
 43031	Charles Darwin, expounded in _The Descent of Man_ and _The Origin
 43032	of Species_. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the
 43033	collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan
 43034	Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X. O'Brien and others,
 43035	the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of
 43036	Charles Stewart Parnell (M. P. for Cork City), the programme of
 43037	peace, retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M. P. for
 43038	Midlothian, N. B.) and, in support of his political convictions, had
 43039	climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree
 43040	on Northumberland road to see the entrance (2 February 1888) into the
 43041	capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000 torchbearers,
 43042	divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2000 torches in escort of
 43043	the marquess of Ripon and (honest) John Morley.
 43044	
 43045	
 43046	How much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence?
 43047	
 43048	As per prospectus of the Industrious Foreign Acclimatised Nationalised
 43049	Friendly Stateaided Building Society (incorporated 1874), a maximum
 43050	of 60 pounds per annum, being 1/6 of an assured income, derived from
 43051	giltedged securities, representing at 5 % simple interest on capital of
 43052	1200 pounds (estimate of price at 20 years' purchase), of which to be
 43053	paid on acquisition and the balance in the form of annual rent, viz. 800
 43054	pounds plus 2 1/2 % interest on the same, repayable quarterly in equal
 43055	annual instalments until extinction by amortisation of loan advanced for
 43056	purchase within a period of 20 years, amounting to an annual rental of
 43057	64 pounds, headrent included, the titledeeds to remain in possession
 43058	of the lender or lenders with a saving clause envisaging forced sale,
 43059	foreclosure and mutual compensation in the event of protracted failure
 43060	to pay the terms assigned, otherwise the messuage to become the absolute
 43061	property of the tenant occupier upon expiry of the period of years
 43062	stipulated.
 43063	
 43064	
 43065	What rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate
 43066	purchase?
 43067	
 43068	A private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash system
 43069	the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase) of I or
 43070	more miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1 at 3 hr
 43071	8 m p.m. at Ascot (Greenwich time), the message being received and
 43072	available for betting purposes in Dublin at 2.59 p.m. (Dunsink time).
 43073	The unexpected discovery of an object of great monetary value (precious
 43074	stone, valuable adhesive or impressed postage stamps (7 schilling,
 43075	mauve, imperforate, Hamburg, 1866: 4 pence, rose, blue paper, perforate,
 43076	Great Britain, 1855: 1 franc, stone, official, rouletted, diagonal
 43077	surcharge, Luxemburg, 1878), antique dynastical ring, unique relic) in
 43078	unusual repositories or by unusual means: from the air (dropped by an
 43079	eagle in flight), by fire (amid the carbonised remains of an incendiated
 43080	edifice), in the sea (amid flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict), on
 43081	earth (in the gizzard of a comestible fowl). A Spanish prisoner's
 43082	donation of a distant treasure of valuables or specie or bullion lodged
 43083	with a solvent banking corporation loo years previously at 5% compound
 43084	interest of the collective worth of 5,000,000 pounds stg (five million
 43085	pounds sterling). A contract with an inconsiderate contractee for the
 43086	delivery of 32 consignments of some given commodity in consideration of
 43087	cash payment on delivery per delivery at the initial rate of 1/4d to be
 43088	increased constantly in the geometrical progression of 2 (1/4d, 1/2d,
 43089	1d, 2d, 4d, 8d, 1s 4d, 2s 8d to 32 terms). A prepared scheme
 43090	based on a study of the laws of probability to break the bank at Monte
 43091	Carlo. A solution of the secular problem of the quadrature of the
 43092	circle, government premium 1,000,000 pounds sterling.
 43093	
 43094	
 43095	Was vast wealth acquirable through industrial channels?
 43096	
 43097	The reclamation of dunams of waste arenary soil, proposed in the
 43098	prospectus of Agendath Netaim, Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 15, by the

 43100	The utilisation of waste paper, fells of sewer rodents, human excrement
 43101	possessing chemical properties, in view of the vast production of the

 43104	annually, cancelling byproducts of water, a sum total of 80 lbs. (mixed
 43105	animal and vegetable diet), to be multiplied by 4,386,035, the total
 43106	population of Ireland according to census returns of 1901.
 43107	
 43108	
 43109	Were there schemes of wider scope?
 43110	
 43111	A scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour
 43112	commissioners for the exploitation of white coal (hydraulic power),
 43113	obtained by hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at Dublin bar or at
 43114	head of water at Poulaphouca or Powerscourt or catchment basins of main
 43115	streams for the economic production of 500,000 W. H. P. of electricity.
 43116	A scheme to enclose the peninsular delta of the North Bull at Dollymount
 43117	and erect on the space of the foreland, used for golf links and rifle
 43118	ranges, an asphalted esplanade with casinos, booths, shooting galleries,
 43119	hotels, boardinghouses, readingrooms, establishments for mixed bathing.
 43120	A scheme for the use of dogvans and goatvans for the delivery of early
 43121	morning milk. A scheme for the development of Irish tourist traffic in
 43122	and around Dublin by means of petrolpropelled riverboats, plying in the
 43123	fluvial fairway between Island bridge and Ringsend, charabancs, narrow
 43124	gauge local railways, and pleasure steamers for coastwise navigation
 43125	(10/- per person per day, guide (trilingual) included). A scheme for
 43126	the repristination of passenger and goods traffics over Irish waterways,
 43127	when freed from weedbeds. A scheme to connect by tramline the Cattle
 43128	Market (North Circular road and Prussia street) with the quays (Sheriff
 43129	street, lower, and East Wall), parallel with the Link line railway
 43130	laid (in conjunction with the Great Southern and Western railway line)
 43131	between the cattle park, Liffey junction, and terminus of Midland Great
 43132	Western Railway 43 to 45 North
 43133	
 43134	Wall, in proximity to the terminal stations or Dublin branches of Great
 43135	Central Railway, Midland Railway of England, City of Dublin Steam Packet
 43136	Company, Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, Dublin and Glasgow

 43144	animal transport and of additional mileage operated by the Dublin United
 43145	Tramways Company, limited, to be covered by graziers' fees.
 43146	
 43147	
 43148	Positing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes
 43149	become a natural and necessary apodosis?
 43150	
 43151	Given a guarantee equal to the sum sought, the support, by deed of
 43152	gift and transfer vouchers during donor's lifetime or by bequest
 43153	after donor's painless extinction, of eminent financiers (Blum Pasha,
 43154	Rothschild Guggenheim, Hirsch, Montefiore, Morgan, Rockefeller)
 43155	possessing fortunes in 6 figures, amassed during a successful life, and
 43156	joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done.
 43157	
 43158	
 43159	What eventuality would render him independent of such wealth?
 43160	
 43161	The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.
 43162	
 43163	
 43164	For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?
 43165	
 43166	It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic
 43167	relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil
 43168	recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for
 43169	the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and
 43170	renovated vitality.
 43171	
 43172	
 43173	His justifications?
 43174	
 43175	As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human
 43176	life at least 2/7, viz. 20 years are passed in sleep. As a philosopher
 43177	he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an
 43178	infinitesimal part of any person's desires has been realised. As a
 43179	physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant
 43180	agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.
 43181	
 43182	
 43183	What did he fear?
 43184	
 43185	The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration
 43186	of the light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence
 43187	situated in the cerebral convolutions.
 43188	
 43189	
 43190	What were habitually his final meditations?
 43191	
 43192	Of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in
 43193	wonder, a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded,
 43194	reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span
 43195	of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life.
 43196	
 43197	
 43198	What did the first drawer unlocked contain?
 43199	
 43200	A Vere Foster's handwriting copybook, property of Milly (Millicent)

 43250	
 43251	
 43252	Quote the textual terms in which the prospectus claimed advantages for
 43253	this thaumaturgic remedy.
 43254	
 43255	It heals and soothes while you sleep, in case of trouble in breaking
 43256	wind, assists nature in the most formidable way, insuring instant relief

 43263	
 43264	
 43265	Were there testimonials?
 43266	
 43267	Numerous. From clergyman, British naval officer, wellknown author, city
 43268	man, hospital nurse, lady, mother of five, absentminded beggar.
 43269	
 43270	
 43271	How did absentminded beggar's concluding testimonial conclude?
 43272	
 43273	What a pity the government did not supply our men with wonderworkers
 43274	during the South African campaign! What a relief it would have been!
 43275	
 43276	
 43277	What object did Bloom add to this collection of objects?
 43278	
 43279	A 4th typewritten letter received by Henry Flower (let H. F. be L. B.)
 43280	from Martha Clifford (find M. C.).
 43281	
 43282	
 43283	What pleasant reflection accompanied this action?
 43284	
 43285	The reflection that, apart from the letter in question, his magnetic
 43286	face, form and address had been favourably received during the course of
 43287	the preceding day by a wife (Mrs Josephine Breen, born Josie Powell),
 43288	a nurse, Miss Callan (Christian name unknown), a maid, Gertrude (Gerty,
 43289	family name unknown).
 43290	
 43291	
 43292	What possibility suggested itself?
 43293	
 43294	The possibility of exercising virile power of fascination in the not
 43295	immediate future after an expensive repast in a private apartment in
 43296	the company of an elegant courtesan, of corporal beauty, moderately
 43297	mercenary, variously instructed, a lady by origin.
 43298	
 43299	
 43300	What did the 2nd drawer contain?
 43301	
 43302	Documents: the birth certificate of Leopold Paula Bloom: an endowment
 43303	assurance policy of 500 pounds in the Scottish Widows' Assurance

 43316	
 43317	
 43318	Quote the textual terms of this notice.
 43319	
 43320	I, Rudolph Virag, now resident at no 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin,
 43321	formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice
 43322	that I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all
 43323	times to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.
 43324	
 43325	
 43326	What other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the
 43327	2nd drawer?
 43328	
 43329	An indistinct daguerreotype of Rudolf Virag and his father Leopold
 43330	Virag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their
 43331	(respectively) 1st and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar,
 43332	Hungary. An ancient haggadah book in which a pair of hornrimmed convex
 43333	spectacles inserted marked the passage of thanksgiving in the ritual
 43334	prayers for Pessach (Passover): a photocard of the Queen's Hotel,
 43335	Ennis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed: _To My Dear Son
 43336	Leopold_.
 43337	
 43338	
 43339	What fractions of phrases did the lecture of those five whole words
 43340	evoke?
 43341	
 43342	Tomorrow will be a week that I received... it is no use Leopold to be
 43343	... with your dear mother... that is not more to stand... to her...
 43344	all for me is out... be kind to Athos, Leopold... my dear son...
 43345	always... of me... _das Herz... Gott... dein_...
 43346	
 43347	
 43348	What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive
 43349	melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?
 43350	
 43351	An old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head covered,
 43352	sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses
 43353	of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the
 43354	face in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison.
 43355	
 43356	
 43357	Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?
 43358	
 43359	Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain
 43360	beliefs and practices.
 43361	
 43362	
 43363	As?
 43364	
 43365	The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the
 43366	hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete
 43367	mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of
 43368	male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the
 43369	ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.
 43370	
 43371	
 43372	How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?
 43373	
 43374	Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than
 43375	other beliefs and practices now appeared.
 43376	
 43377	
 43378	What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?
 43379	
 43380	Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a
 43381	retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between
 43382	Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with
 43383	statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia,
 43384	empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having
 43385	taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).
 43386	Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant
 43387	consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by
 43388	suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the
 43389	various centres mentioned.
 43390	
 43391	
 43392	Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these
 43393	migrations in narrator and listener?
 43394	
 43395	In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of
 43396	narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of
 43397	the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.
 43398	
 43399	
 43400	What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of
 43401	amnesia?
 43402	
 43403	Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.
 43404	Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an
 43405	inclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food
 43406	by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.
 43407	
 43408	
 43409	What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?
 43410	
 43411	The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon
 43412	repletion.
 43413	
 43414	
 43415	What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?
 43416	
 43417	The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the
 43418	possession of scrip.
 43419	
 43420	
 43421	Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which
 43422	these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values
 43423	to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.
 43424	
 43425	Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor
 43426	hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and
 43427	doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy:
 43428	that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1s. 4d.
 43429	in the pound, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant,
 43430	insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated
 43431	bailiffs man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric
 43432	public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded
 43433	perforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate of Old Man's House (Royal
 43434	Hospital) Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson's Hospital for reduced but
 43435	respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight. Nadir of
 43436	misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic
 43437	pauper.
 43438	
 43439	
 43440	With which attendant indignities?
 43441	
 43442	The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the
 43443	contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread,
 43444	the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of
 43445	illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of
 43446	decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less
 43447	than nothing.
 43448	
 43449	
 43450	By what could such a situation be precluded?
 43451	
 43452	By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).
 43453	
 43454	
 43455	Which preferably?
 43456	
 43457	The latter, by the line of least resistance.
 43458	
 43459	
 43460	What considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?
 43461	
 43462	Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects.
 43463	The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity
 43464	to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.
 43465	
 43466	
 43467	What considerations rendered departure not irrational?
 43468	
 43469	The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which
 43470	being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if
 43471	not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication,
 43472	which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting
 43473	parties, which was impossible.
 43474	
 43475	
 43476	What considerations rendered departure desirable?
 43477	
 43478	The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad,
 43479	as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or
 43480	in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and
 43481	hachures.
 43482	
 43483	
 43484	In Ireland?
 43485	
 43486	The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with
 43487	submerged petrified city, the Giant's Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort
 43488	Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the
 43489	pastures of royal Meath, Brigid's elm in Kildare, the Queen's Island
 43490	shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.
 43491	
 43492	
 43493	Abroad?
 43494	
 43495	Ceylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for
 43496	Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing Lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame
 43497	street, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate
 43498	of Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique
 43499	birthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues of nude
 43500	Grecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled
 43501	international finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where
 43502	O'Hara of the Camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human
 43503	being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters
 43504	of soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller
 43505	returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea.
 43506	
 43507	
 43508	Under what guidance, following what signs?
 43509	
 43510	At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of
 43511	intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior produced
 43512	and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled
 43513	triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha
 43514	delta of Ursa Maior. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed
 43515	in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice
 43516	of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating
 43517	female, a pillar of the cloud by day.
 43518	
 43519	
 43520	What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?
 43521	
 43522	5 pounds reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles
 43523	street, missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold
 43524	(Poldy), height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may
 43525	have since grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above
 43526	sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery.
 43527	
 43528	
 43529	What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and
 43530	nonentity?
 43531	
 43532	Assumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.
 43533	
 43534	
 43535	What tributes his?
 43536	
 43537	Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph
 43538	immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.
 43539	
 43540	
 43541	Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?
 43542	
 43543	Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his
 43544	cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic
 43545	planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of
 43546	space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere
 43547	imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey
 43548	the summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of
 43549	the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the
 43550	constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination
 43551	return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark
 43552	crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition)
 43553	surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.
 43554	
 43555	
 43556	What would render such return irrational?
 43557	
 43558	An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through
 43559	reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible
 43560	time.
 43561	
 43562	
 43563	What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?
 43564	
 43565	The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity
 43566	of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares,
 43567	rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the
 43568	proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of
 43569	warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and
 43570	rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo,
 43571	desired desire.
 43572	
 43573	
 43574	What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an
 43575	unoccupied bed?
 43576	
 43577	The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human
 43578	(mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of
 43579	matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the
 43580	case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the
 43581	spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).
 43582	
 43583	
 43584	What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of
 43585	accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?
 43586	
 43587	The preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion and
 43588	premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John): the
 43589	funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes (Urim and
 43590	Thummim): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchisedek): the visit to
 43591	museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along Bedford
 43592	row, Merchants' Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the music in the
 43593	Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a truculent troglodyte
 43594	in Bernard Kiernan's premises (holocaust): a blank period of time
 43595	including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking
 43596	(wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism (rite of
 43597	Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy (heave offering):
 43598	the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone
 43599	street, lower and subsequent brawl and chance medley in Beaver street
 43600	(Armageddon)--nocturnal perambulation to and from the cabman's shelter,
 43601	Butt Bridge (atonement).
 43602	
 43603	
 43604	What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to
 43605	conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?
 43606	
 43607	The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by
 43608	the insentient material of a strainveined timber table.
 43609	
 43610	
 43611	What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured
 43612	multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not
 43613	comprehend?
 43614	
 43615	Who was M'Intosh?
 43616	
 43617	
 43618	What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30
 43619	years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction
 43620	of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?
 43621	
 43622	Where was Moses when the candle went out?
 43623	
 43624	
 43625	What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, charged with
 43626	collected articles of recently disvested male wearing apparel, silently,
 43627	successively, enumerate?
 43628	
 43629	A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement: to obtain
 43630	a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook,
 43631	Robertson and Co, 5 Dame Street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing Lane, London E.
 43632	C.): to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in
 43633	the case of Hellenic female divinities: to obtain admission (gratuitous
 43634	or paid) to the performance of Leah by Mrs Bandmann Palmer at the Gaiety
 43635	Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street.
 43636	
 43637	
 43638	What impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?
 43639	
 43640	The face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin
 43641	Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin's Barn.
 43642	
 43643	
 43644	What recurrent impressions of the same were possible by hypothesis?
 43645	
 43646	Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens
 43647	street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines
 43648	meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from
 43649	infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the
 43650	Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.
 43651	
 43652	
 43653	What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were
 43654	perceived by him?
 43655	
 43656	A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, a pair of new
 43657	violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on
 43658	generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti's Turkish
 43659	cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded
 43660	curvilinear, a camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion
 43661	underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed
 43662	irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened,
 43663	having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore
 43664	side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).
 43665	
 43666	
 43667	What impersonal objects were perceived?
 43668	
 43669	A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne
 43670	cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady's black straw hat.
 43671	Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware
 43672	and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed
 43673	irregularly on the washstand and floor and consisting of basin, soapdish
 43674	and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article
 43675	(on the floor, separate).
 43676	
 43677	
 43678	Bloom's acts?
 43679	
 43680	He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining
 43681	articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the
 43682	bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the
 43683	proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to
 43684	the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the
 43685	bed.
 43686	
 43687	
 43688	How?
 43689	
 43690	With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or
 43691	not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress
 43692	being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous
 43693	under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of
 43694	lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of
 43695	conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of
 43696	marriage, of sleep and of death.
 43697	
 43698	
 43699	What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?
 43700	
 43701	New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,
 43702	female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,
 43703	some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.
 43704	
 43705	
 43706	If he had smiled why would he have smiled?
 43707	
 43708	To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to
 43709	enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if
 43710	the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,
 43711	last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor
 43712	alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.
 43713	
 43714	
 43715	What preceding series?
 43716	
 43717	Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell
 43718	d'Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father
 43719	Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's Horse Show,
 43720	Maggot O'Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor
 43721	of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder,
 43722	an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon
 43723	Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John
 43724	Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack
 43725	at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so
 43726	on to no last term.
 43727	
 43728	
 43729	What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and
 43730	late occupant of the bed?
 43731	
 43732	Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a
 43733	billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a
 43734	boaster).
 43735	
 43736	
 43737	Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal
 43738	proportion and commercial ability?
 43739	
 43740	Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding
 43741	members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably
 43742	transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with
 43743	desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene
 43744	comprehension and apprehension.
 43745	
 43746	
 43747	With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections
 43748	affected?
 43749	
 43750	Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.
 43751	
 43752	
 43753	Envy?
 43754	
 43755	Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
 43756	superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic
 43757	piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of
 43758	a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental
 43759	female organism, passive but not obtuse.
 43760	
 43761	
 43762	Jealousy?
 43763	
 43764	Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately
 43765	the agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between agent(s)
 43766	and reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of
 43767	increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial
 43768	reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of
 43769	attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.
 43770	
 43771	
 43772	Abnegation?
 43773	
 43774	In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the
 43775	establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden
 43776	Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and
 43777	reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of
 43778	ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)
 43779	extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative,
 43780	e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net
 43781	proceeds divided.
 43782	
 43783	
 43784	Equanimity?
 43785	
 43786	As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or
 43787	understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance
 43788	with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.
 43789	As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in
 43790	consequence of a collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than
 43791	theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money
 43792	under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public
 43793	money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of
 43794	minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason,
 43795	felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking,
 43796	practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field,
 43797	perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies,
 43798	impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated
 43799	murder. As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of
 43800	adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal
 43801	equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances,
 43802	foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant
 43803	disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.
 43804	
 43805	
 43806	Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?
 43807	
 43808	From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but
 43809	outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially
 43810	violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the
 43811	adulterously violated.
 43812	
 43813	
 43814	What retribution, if any?
 43815	
 43816	Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by
 43817	combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic
 43818	bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet. Suit
 43819	for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of
 43820	injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. Hushmoney by moral
 43821	influence possibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of
 43822	emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral,
 43823	a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation,
 43824	humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other,
 43825	protecting the separator from both.
 43826	
 43827	
 43828	By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of
 43829	incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?
 43830	
 43831	The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility
 43832	of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between
 43833	the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the
 43834	selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done; the fallaciously inferred
 43835	debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of
 43836	ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving
 43837	no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as
 43838	masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct
 43839	feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist
 43840	preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb
 43841	and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary
 43842	masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of
 43843	seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by
 43844	distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the
 43845	inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy
 43846	of the stars.
 43847	
 43848	
 43849	In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and
 43850	reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?
 43851	
 43852	Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial
 43853	hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored
 43854	(the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of
 43855	Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female
 43856	hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and
 43857	seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude,
 43858	insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression,
 43859	expressive of mute immutable mature animality.
 43860	
 43861	
 43862	The visible signs of antesatisfaction?
 43863	
 43864	An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a
 43865	tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.
 43866	
 43867	
 43868	Then?
 43869	
 43870	He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each
 43871	plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure
 43872	prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.
 43873	
 43874	
 43875	The visible signs of postsatisfaction?
 43876	
 43877	A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a
 43878	solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.
 43879	
 43880	
 43881	What followed this silent action?
 43882	
 43883	Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,
 43884	catechetical interrogation.
 43885	
 43886	
 43887	With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?
 43888	
 43889	Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between
 43890	Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and
 43891	in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co,
 43892	Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation
 43893	and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty),
 43894	surname unknown. Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs
 43895	Bandmann Palmer of LEAH at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King
 43896	street, an invitation to supper at Wynn's (Murphy's) Hotel, 35, 36 and
 43897	37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency
 43898	entituled SWEETS OF SIN, anonymous author a gentleman of fashion, a
 43899	temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the
 43900	course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely
 43901	recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving
 43902	son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat
 43903	executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor
 43904	and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic
 43905	flexibility.
 43906	
 43907	
 43908	Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?
 43909	
 43910	Absolutely.
 43911	
 43912	
 43913	Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?
 43914	
 43915	Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.
 43916	
 43917	
 43918	What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were
 43919	perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the
 43920	course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?
 43921	
 43922	By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been
 43923	celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8
 43924	September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with
 43925	female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated
 43926	on the lo September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse,
 43927	with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last
 43928	taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29
 43929	December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894,
 43930	aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days
 43931	during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation
 43932	of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation
 43933	of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental
 43934	intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since
 43935	the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the
 43936	female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained
 43937	a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of a
 43938	preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the
 43939	consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of
 43940	action had been circumscribed.
 43941	
 43942	
 43943	How?
 43944	
 43945	By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine
 43946	destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration
 43947	for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences,
 43948	projected or effected.
 43949	
 43950	
 43951	What moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible
 43952	thoughts?
 43953	
 43954	The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of
 43955	concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.
 43956	
 43957	
 43958	In what directions did listener and narrator lie?
 43959	
 43960	Listener, S. E. by E.: Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel
 43961	of latitude, N., and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45
 43962	degrees to the terrestrial equator.
 43963	
 43964	
 43965	In what state of rest or motion?
 43966	
 43967	At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each
 43968	and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the
 43969	proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of
 43970	neverchanging space.
 43971	
 43972	
 43973	In what posture?
 43974	
 43975	Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right
 43976	leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the
 43977	attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator:
 43978	reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the index
 43979	finger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in
 43980	the attitude depicted in a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the
 43981	childman weary, the manchild in the womb.
 43982	
 43983	
 43984	Womb? Weary?
 43985	
 43986	He rests. He has travelled.
 43987	
 43988	
 43989	With?
 43990	
 43991	Sinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and
 43992	Whinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and

 43996	
 43997	
 43998	When?
 43999	
 44000	Going to dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc's auk's
 44001	egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of Darkinbad the
 44002	Brightdayler.
 44003	
 44004	
 44005	Where?
 44006	
 44007	
 44008	
 44009	Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his
 44010	breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel
 44011	when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his
 44012	highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan
 44013	that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing
 44014	all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually
 44015	afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her
 44016	ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes
 44017	and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the
 44018	world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks
 44019	of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because
 44020	no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder
 44021	she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman
 44022	certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there
 44023	I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and
 44024	always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like
 44025	that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too
 44026	hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything
 44027	really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into
 44028	a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it
 44029	into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing
 44030	on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun
 44031	maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes
 44032	because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman
 44033	to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that
 44034	dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at
 44035	the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress
 44036	Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the
 44037	bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with
 44038	her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to
 44039	never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard
 44040	a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and
 44041	dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed
 44042	get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what
 44043	attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble
 44044	they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its
 44045	not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those
 44046	night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he
 44047	made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I
 44048	meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see
 44049	that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a
 44050	young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked
 44051	out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make
 44052	up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of
 44053	all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for
 44054	I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some
 44055	little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the
 44056	sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before
 44057	yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the
 44058	front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told
 44059	me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking
 44060	about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks
 44061	she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age
 44062	especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she
 44063	can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my
 44064	bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with
 44065	or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont
 44066	have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary
 44067	we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad
 44068	enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice
 44069	I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the
 44070	long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen
 44071	pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was
 44072	all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could
 44073	eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my
 44074	house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see
 44075	her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had
 44076	something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he
 44077	said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of
 44078	oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to
 44079	be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I
 44080	found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little
 44081	bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her
 44082	weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the
 44083	rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt
 44084	I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even
 44085	touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven
 44086	like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in
 44087	the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt
 44088	possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last
 44089	time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a
 44090	great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another
 44091	I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back
 44092	singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea
 44093	about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to
 44094	the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case
 44095	God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the
 44096	same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do
 44097	it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with
 44098	him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn
 44099	red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down
 44100	on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour
 44101	question and answer would you do this that and the other with the
 44102	coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean
 44103	or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was
 44104	knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and
 44105	so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging
 44106	him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are
 44107	you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german
 44108	Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to
 44109	make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this
 44110	age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it
 44111	pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway
 44112	and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with
 44113	all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time
 44114	after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why
 44115	cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes
 44116	love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help
 44117	yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there
 44118	and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to
 44119	your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used
 44120	to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did
 44121	where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your
 44122	person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was
 44123	it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and
 44124	have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever
 44125	way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father
 44126	what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had
 44127	a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither
 44128	would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know
 44129	me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed
 44130	never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre
 44131	lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone
 44132	them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of
 44133	incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if
 44134	youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H
 44135	H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I
 44136	didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall
 44137	though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking
 44138	of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in
 44139	it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of
 44140	drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick
 44141	their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green
 44142	and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the
 44143	opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that
 44144	had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to
 44145	keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the
 44146	port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely
 44147	and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped
 44148	straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us
 44149	I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I
 44150	blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in
 44151	Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and
 44152	tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing
 44153	about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that
 44154	evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought
 44155	its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church
 44156	mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey
 44157	matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the
 44158	lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red
 44159	brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they
 44160	call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took
 44161	off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and
 44162	perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar
 44163	standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he
 44164	was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had
 44165	one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole
 44166	sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the
 44167	middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all
 44168	they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had
 44169	to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in
 44170	him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is
 44171	so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last
 44172	time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for
 44173	him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it
 44174	themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would
 44175	believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing
 44176	out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year
 44177	as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one
 44178	they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on
 44179	it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of
 44180	them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears
 44181	supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like
 44182	elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off
 44183	him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child
 44184	but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly
 44185	I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about
 44186	me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll
 44187	do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene
 44188	he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons
 44189	housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account
 44190	of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup
 44191	row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a
 44192	carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about
 44193	everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew
 44194	he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me
 44195	so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup
 44196	things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study
 44197	up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could
 44198	always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him
 44199	after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he
 44200	used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going
 44201	to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byron's poems
 44202	and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily
 44203	get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in
 44204	with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he
 44205	refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the
 44206	collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out I
 44207	kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let
 44208	him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes
 44209	mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and
 44210	ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool
 44211	me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his
 44212	plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own
 44213	job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could
 44214	hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking
 44215	me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres
 44216	something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was
 44217	in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let
 44218	out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let
 44219	him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me
 44220	Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and
 44221	when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did
 44222	you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on
 44223	thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on
 44224	the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what
 44225	spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at
 44226	that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he
 44227	was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged
 44228	afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of
 44229	laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling
 44230	out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great
 44231	humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it
 44232	meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us
 44233	not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault
 44234	she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes
 44235	got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her
 44236	face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she
 44237	must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she
 44238	was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him
 44239	to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to
 44240	go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine
 44241	having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you
 44242	any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy
 44243	anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes
 44244	in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes
 44245	off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going
 44246	about in his slippers to look for 10000 pounds for a postcard U p up
 44247	O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to
 44248	extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what
 44249	could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than marry
 44250	another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to
 44251	put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows
 44252	that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned
 44253	her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was
 44254	found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing
 44255	like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad
 44256	and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them
 44257	for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on
 44258	without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I
 44259	wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek
 44260	leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with
 44261	the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if
 44262	that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough
 44263	to go and hang a woman surely are they
 44264	
 44265	theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he
 44266	noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C
 44267	with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both
 44268	ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his
 44269	two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was
 44270	what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches
 44271	he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all
 44272	myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I
 44273	did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after
 44274	some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times
 44275	lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs
 44276	Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning
 44277	door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea 2 days
 44278	after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was
 44279	crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes
 44280	that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a
 44281	ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one
 44282	and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend
 44283	once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold
 44284	and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire
 44285	wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the
 44286	hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots
 44287	hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course
 44288	hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I
 44289	could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that
 44290	mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition
 44291	just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so
 44292	polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was
 44293	tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell dArcy too that he used to
 44294	make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I
 44295	sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me
 44296	straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot
 44297	for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if
 44298	you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he
 44299	said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see
 44300	anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now
 44301	and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place
 44302	too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing
 44303	can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we
 44304	were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was
 44305	lo times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off
 44306	my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed
 44307	me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions
 44308	is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it
 44309	as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket
 44310	of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen
 44311	always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their
 44312	skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with
 44313	him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right
 44314	against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me
 44315	from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however
 44316	standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on
 44317	him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion
 44318	and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there
 44319	where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from
 44320	anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but
 44321	they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him
 44322	coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping
 44323	away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I
 44324	halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my
 44325	glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for
 44326	the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers
 44327	the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll
 44328	to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look
 44329	a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me
 44330	hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat
 44331	I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel
 44332	down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new
 44333	raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so
 44334	savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched
 44335	his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand
 44336	to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find
 44337	out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want
 44338	to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father
 44339	waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in
 44340	the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me
 44341	that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any
 44342	woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met
 44343	asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I
 44344	wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was
 44345	always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky
 44346	man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake
 44347	dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course
 44348	it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in
 44349	Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children
 44350	seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice
 44351	a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman
 44352	when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote
 44353	the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it
 44354	simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to
 44355	embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the
 44356	same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you
 44357	think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or
 44358	the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface
 44359	Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after
 44360	dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me
 44361	professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his
 44362	way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you
 44363	have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought
 44364	it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I
 44365	was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a
 44366	fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been
 44367	a bit late because it was l/4 after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls
 44368	coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me
 44369	never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw
 44370	the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was
 44371	whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my
 44372	clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go
 44373	to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary
 44374	the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel
 44375	were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt
 44376	tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps
 44377	some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed
 44378	never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a
 44379	husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did
 44380	anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where
 44381	he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the
 44382	Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of
 44383	us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup
 44384	splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter
 44385	after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the
 44386	engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen
 44387	in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so
 44388	pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was
 44389	able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on
 44390	to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting
 44391	in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take
 44392	a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the
 44393	guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at
 44394	us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an
 44395	exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage
 44396	that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him l or 2
 44397	tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer
 44398	then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped
 44399	with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where
 44400	its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little
 44401	chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like
 44402	on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded
 44403	beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it
 44404	all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt
 44405	put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going
 44406	around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to
 44407	that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano
 44408	lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about
 44409	with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves
 44410	talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed
 44411	me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he
 44412	well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him
 44413	he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after
 44414	the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut
 44415	Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely
 44416	fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave
 44417	too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock
 44418	my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be
 44419	seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never
 44420	felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul
 44421	and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them
 44422	instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were
 44423	with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so
 44424	bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the
 44425	Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay
 44426	from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham
 44427	battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the
 44428	march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the
 44429	lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his
 44430	money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a
 44431	nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up
 44432	there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I
 44433	had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going
 44434	round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave
 44435	this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the
 44436	knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or
 44437	tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and
 44438	smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes
 44439	not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find
 44440	out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked
 44441	close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression
 44442	besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big
 44443	hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having
 44444	to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way
 44445	Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and
 44446	stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild
 44447	with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes
 44448	them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks
 44449	with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly well off I know by
 44450	the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect
 44451	devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up
 44452	the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost
 44453	over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of
 44454	Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making
 44455	free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over
 44456	the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his
 44457	dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert
 44458	when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked
 44459	every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty
 44460	and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat
 44461	everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked
 44462	silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into
 44463	my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for
 44464	money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to
 44465	be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be
 44466	noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I
 44467	want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know
 44468	what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and
 44469	half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made
 44470	them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of
 44471	what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered
 44472	after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this
 44473	morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to
 44474	upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole
 44475	thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in
 44476	the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have
 44477	but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line
 44478	11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to
 44479	reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the
 44480	stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from
 44481	ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they
 44482	call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a
 44483	bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get
 44484	anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or
 44485	I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good
 44486	might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters
 44487	that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me
 44488	out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion
 44489	I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him
 44490	over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget
 44491	it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him 111 know by
 44492	the bottle anyway if not I suppose 111 only have to wash in my piss like
 44493	beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought
 44494	it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much
 44495	finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity
 44496	it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/- in all
 44497	sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and
 44498	rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always
 44499	want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if
 44500	I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes how
 44501	much were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and
 44502	jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting
 44503	up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and
 44504	women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all
 44505	the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more I have of life
 44506	up to 35 no Im what am I at all 111 be 33 in September will I what O
 44507	well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when
 44508	I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman
 44509	magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like
 44510	that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning
 44511	to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it
 44512	pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry
 44513	the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like
 44514	the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all
 44515	made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what
 44516	was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what
 44517	was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind
 44518	of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster
 44519	knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings
 44520	me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about
 44521	a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for
 44522	any priest to write and her a--e as if any fool wouldnt know what that
 44523	meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards
 44524	face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants
 44525	he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 5 o the part
 44526	about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate
 44527	sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he
 44528	drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like
 44529	the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms
 44530	sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought
 44531	first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber
 44532	when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H
 44533	he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too
 44534	where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might
 44535	have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as
 44536	I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings
 44537	he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get
 44538	regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count
 44539	the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house
 44540	so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed
 44541	even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending
 44542	to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr
 44543	Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up
 44544	I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great
 44545	mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and
 44546	truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress
 44547	that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre
 44548	coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was
 44549	no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Bums
 44550	as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a
 44551	lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me
 44552	altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and
 44553	cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if
 44554	I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes
 44555	take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles
 44556	off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my
 44557	backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton
 44558	street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as
 44559	ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too
 44560	much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was
 44561	awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked
 44562	Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very
 44563	hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of
 44564	him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me
 44565	without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and
 44566	me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was
 44567	out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you
 44568	were
 44569	
 44570	yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he
 44571	made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow
 44572	stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up
 44573	and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him
 44574	what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same
 44575	in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there
 44576	like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with
 44577	her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks
 44578	like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of
 44579	him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a
 44580	cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or
 44581	that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue
 44582	of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing
 44583	standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the
 44584	Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them
 44585	theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed
 44586	outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to
 44587	try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was I of the
 44588	7 wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night
 44589	coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade
 44590	to make you feel nice and watery I went into r of them it was so biting
 44591	cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was
 44592	a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see
 44593	me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of
 44594	it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not
 44595	afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the
 44596	woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a
 44597	picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the
 44598	job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee
 44599	palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only
 44600	shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo
 44601	he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and
 44602	that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some
 44603	jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply
 44604	the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of
 44605	the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his
 44606	teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent
 44607	they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly
 44608	enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a
 44609	pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate

 44621	woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was
 44622	here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel
 44623	all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd
 44624	time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about 5 minutes
 44625	with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout
 44626	out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look

 44681	when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with
 44682	the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the
 44683	storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting
 44684	in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he
 44685	got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with
 44686	father and captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the
 44687	windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like
 44688	all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked
 44689	at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was
 44690	attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent
 44691	looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in
 44692	the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the
 44693	excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been
 44694	nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me
 44695	the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East

 44704	fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift
 44705	drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair
 44706	when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa
 44707	cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night
 44708	and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems

 44726	ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood
 44727	dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old
 44728	bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate
 44729	poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place
 44730	more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites
 44731	assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and
 44732	the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and
 44733	only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and
 44734	sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for

 44794	
 44795	Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio
 44796	brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her
 44797	to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin
 44798	to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her
 44799	in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her
 44800	appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a loo her face a mass of wrinkles
 44801	with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the
 44802	Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack
 44803	flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took
 44804	all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in
 44805	Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was
 44806	a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed
 44807	virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on Easter
 44808	Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing
 44809	the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer
 44810	he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when
 44811	I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then
 44812	he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an
 44813	appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up
 44814	in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to
 44815	find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember
 44816	shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to
 44817	near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my
 44818	sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till
 44819	he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my
 44820	knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was
 44821	engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de
 44822	la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in 3 years
 44823	time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that
 44824	bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be
 44825	imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt
 44826	have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he
 44827	brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I
 44828	taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was
 44829	too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant
 44830	king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new
 44831	fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower
 44832	I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes
 44833	they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each
 44834	others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing
 44835	the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear
 44836	he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to
 44837	encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just
 44838	beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove
 44839	a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the
 44840	galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels
 44841	cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and
 44842	ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the
 44843	monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like
 44844	chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could
 44845	do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love
 44846	doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white
 44847	ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the
 44848	best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I
 44849	could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment
 44850	but I wouldnt lee him he was awfully put out first for fear you never
 44851	know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant
 44852	Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried
 44853	with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me
 44854	somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was
 44855	up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there
 44856	where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and
 44857	then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres
 44858	a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it
 44859	off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to
 44860	be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my
 44861	petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the
 44862	life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel
 44863	rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was
 44864	shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little
 44865	when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and
 44866	drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men
 44867	down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me
 44868	what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant
 44869	he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to
 44870	the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said
 44871	hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married
 44872	hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me
 44873	now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly
 44874	20 years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and
 44875	put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young
 44876	still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is
 44877	quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she
 44878	little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt
 44879	of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might
 44880	say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit
 44881	wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady
 44882	Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons
 44883	screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round
 44884	by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out
 44885	the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he
 44886	didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore
 44887	crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat
 44888	that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans
 44889	higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak
 44890	caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I
 44891	suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my
 44892	name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a
 44893	visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre
 44894	looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better
 44895	than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them
 44896	Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad
 44897	about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she
 44898	was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely
 44899	one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to
 44900	Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they
 44901	were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now
 44902	when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping
 44903	up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and
 44904	throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those
 44905	men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they
 44906	might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be
 44907	drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats
 44908	that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the
 44909	sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock
 44910	from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I
 44911	could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas
 44912	mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry
 44913	Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at
 44914	mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and
 44915	weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there
 44916	was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau
 44917	dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I
 44918	wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for
 44919	luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed
 44920	him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as
 44921	if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must
 44922	have been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could
 44923	you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that
 44924	derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit
 44925	no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face
 44926	cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that train again weeping tone

 44978	summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then
 44979	stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the

 44988	the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg
 44989	wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the
 44990	stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play
 44991	with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she
 44992	fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their
 44993	claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when

 45006	first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with
 45007	some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down

 45012	with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if
 45013	anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say
 45014	yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the
 45015	weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the
 45016	left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his
 45017	oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can
 45018	swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in
 45019	his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before
 45020	all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was
 45021	black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed
 45022	chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City
 45023	Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he
 45024	wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no
 45025	love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that book
 45026	he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de
 45027	Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his
 45028	tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes
 45029	all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all
 45030	blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of
 45031	the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay
 45032	round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens
 45033	baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall
 45034	old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to
 45035	get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like
 45036	being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have
 45037	to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved
 45038	in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor
 45039	drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go
 45040	and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like
 45041	all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw
 45042	through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the
 45043	honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he
 45044	had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O
 45045	how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if
 45046	not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a
 45047	leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving
 45048	us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust
 45049	with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to
 45050	prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he
 45051	was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and
 45052	murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or
 45053	whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy
 45054	till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again
 45055	being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot
 45056	or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor
 45057	old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not
 45058	that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure
 45059	I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a
 45060	candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet
 45061	frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could
 45062	for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows
 45063	still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for
 45064	him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account
 45065	of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed
 45066	have to learn not like me getting all IS at school only hed do a thing
 45067	like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did
 45068	it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn
 45069	round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave
 45070	me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair
 45071	against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove
 45072	get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase
 45073	with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off
 45074	that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before
 45075	she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant
 45076	see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of
 45077	course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking
 45078	to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she
 45079	pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the
 45080	house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of
 45081	fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with
 45082	her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and
 45083	laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see
 45084	now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating
 45085	me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly
 45086	come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her
 45087	round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well
 45088	he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to
 45089	go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I
 45090	smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button
 45091	I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I
 45092	tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a
 45093	parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out
 45094	no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste
 45095	your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle
 45096	blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on
 45097	show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at
 45098	her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on
 45099	you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the
 45100	Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching
 45101	me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that
 45102	touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always
 45103	trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for
 45104	Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed
 45105	like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me
 45106	there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to
 45107	get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same
 45108	little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but
 45109	he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the
 45110	Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance
 45111	on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands
 45112	swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything
 45113	deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into the
 45114	wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that
 45115	Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with
 45116	sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he
 45117	looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and
 45118	supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man
 45119	gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a
 45120	few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really
 45121	happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their
 45122	natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that
 45123	would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the
 45124	head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself
 45125	after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making
 45126	love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up
 45127	at I S my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that
 45128	all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her
 45129	lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use
 45130	going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when
 45131	I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe
 45132	Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her
 45133	trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her 2
 45134	damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering
 45135	me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of
 45136	course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was
 45137	a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it
 45138	and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that
 45139	because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he
 45140	doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the
 45141	teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place
 45142	its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of
 45143	getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant
 45144	again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed
 45145	revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be
 45146	walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and
 45147	farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good
 45148	job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the
 45149	dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out
 45150	the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he
 45151	walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially
 45152	Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with
 45153	his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his
 45154	sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those
 45155	prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing
 45156	over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear
 45157	a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt
 45158	enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he
 45159	right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers
 45160	might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed
 45161	ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them
 45162	he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the
 45163	fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her
 45164	paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them
 45165	disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its
 45166	drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every
 45167	day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im
 45168	stretched out dead in my grave I suppose 111 have some peace I want to
 45169	get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on

 45171	and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday
 45172	wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men
 45173	do God knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4
 45174	weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came
 45175	on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn
 45176	gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he
 45177	did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I
 45178	wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with
 45179	his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his
 45180	soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I
 45181	could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to
 45182	sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in
 45183	a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the
 45184	gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and
 45185	had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after
 45186	to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat
 45187	itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O
 45188	patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make
 45189	me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just
 45190	put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn
 45191	it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin
 45192	for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a
 45193	widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry

 45195	sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and
 45196	cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens
 45197	I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I
 45198	suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom
 45199	I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut
 45200	all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl
 45201	wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on
 45202	me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a
 45203	holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder
 45204	was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair
 45205	purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other
 45206	room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my
 45207	breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one
 45208	time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O
 45209	Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some
 45210	fellow 111 have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he
 45211	never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the
 45212	smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a
 45213	peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman
 45214	O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the
 45215	waters come down at Lahore
 45216	
 45217	who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I
 45218	something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was
 45219	it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the
 45220	doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white
 45221	thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr
 45222	Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I
 45223	suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round
 45224	those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little
 45225	fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so
 45226	theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in
 45227	the world besides theres something queer about their children always
 45228	smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did
 45229	had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold
 45230	maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face
 45231	for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you
 45232	pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of
 45233	Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the
 45234	way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can
 45235	squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles
 45236	still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys
 45237	when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same
 45238	paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking
 45239	me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words
 45240	they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I
 45241	wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else
 45242	still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so
 45243	severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O
 45244	anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot
 45245	that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters
 45246	my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything
 45247	underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever
 45248	something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at
 45249	myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure
 45250	O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was
 45251	coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how
 45252	the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we
 45253	stood staring at one another for about lo minutes as if we met somewhere
 45254	I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used
 45255	to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him
 45256	and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament
 45257	O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule
 45258	and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the
 45259	Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine
 45260	that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion
 45261	and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he
 45262	as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton
 45263	square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to
 45264	wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the
 45265	gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better
 45266	not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a
 45267	natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to
 45268	do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits
 45269	he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he
 45270	without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out
 45271	all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god
 45272	he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all
 45273	yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes
 45274	sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and
 45275	Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always
 45276	imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed
 45277	too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking
 45278	thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old
 45279	press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time
 45280	somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of
 45281	course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope
 45282	theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves
 45283	up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly
 45284	bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it
 45285	often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used
 45286	to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O
 45287	I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many
 45288	houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard
 45289	street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on
 45290	the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the
 45291	men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse
 45292	and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always
 45293	somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them
 45294	always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right
 45295	something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr
 45296	Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old
 45297	lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives
 45298	impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the
 45299	Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the
 45300	freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling
 45301	along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much
 45302	consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed
 45303	judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres
 45304	Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour l wait 2 oclock well
 45305	thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody
 45306	climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that
 45307	little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if
 45308	he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I
 45309	dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies
 45310	then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you
 45311	then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece
 45312	he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life
 45313	without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more
 45314	with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the
 45315	kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in
 45316	their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then
 45317	tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose
 45318	Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one
 45319	night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor
 45320	half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged
 45321	to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be
 45322	petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does
 45323	it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too
 45324	flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do
 45325	it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the
 45326	coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head
 45327	with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage
 45328	with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her
 45329	Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call
 45330	him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was
 45331	with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs
 45332	bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing
 45333	his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to
 45334	wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this
 45335	is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the
 45336	grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers
 45337	funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse
 45338	walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little
 45339	barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk
 45340	in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and
 45341	Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in
 45342	her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and
 45343	her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other
 45344	way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call
 45345	that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with
 45346	their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that
 45347	barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick
 45348	or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though
 45349	hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well
 45350	theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can
 45351	help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes
 45352	on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every
 45353	penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and
 45354	family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a
 45355	way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was
 45356	insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and
 45357	her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows
 45358	weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if
 45359	youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner
 45360	and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail
 45361	to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and
 45362	grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty
 45363	didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a
 45364	spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for
 45365	that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he
 45366	was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the
 45367	old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the
 45368	hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana
 45369	with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious
 45370	voice Phoebe dearest goodbye _sweet_heart sweetheart he always sang it
 45371	not like Bartell Darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of
 45372	the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath
 45373	O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too
 45374	high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to
 45375	May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of
 45376	it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author
 45377	and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons
 45378	what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I
 45379	ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion
 45380	still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it
 45381	altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the
 45382	Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats
 45383	11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into
 45384	mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was
 45385	enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course
 45386	he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by
 45387	this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his
 45388	lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I
 45389	saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by
 45390	God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid
 45391	out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met
 45392	before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either
 45393	besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after
 45394	that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on
 45395	its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise
 45396	in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look
 45397	at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about
 45398	poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or
 45399	standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only
 45400	getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry
 45401	when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not
 45402	an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I
 45403	wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15
 45404	yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose
 45405	hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not
 45406	that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting
 45407	down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of
 45408	course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was
 45409	out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not
 45410	a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson
 45411	they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont
 45412	find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where
 45413	poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully
 45414	coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point
 45415	the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back
 45416	there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that
 45417	for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly
 45418	bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star
 45419	itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk
 45420	to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad
 45421	and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their
 45422	business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to
 45423	meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those
 45424	fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the
 45425	side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something
 45426	and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that
 45427	thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he
 45428	bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders
 45429	his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you
 45430	I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock
 45431	there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was
 45432	looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks
 45433	with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went
 45434	down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed
 45435	be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of
 45436	washing it from I years end to the other the most of them only thats
 45437	what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only
 45438	get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the 1st thing
 45439	in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing
 45440	the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can
 45441	find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think
 45442	me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the
 45443	other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under
 45444	me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2
 45445	photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am
 45446	I going to do about him though
 45447	
 45448	no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no
 45449	nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because
 45450	I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a
 45451	cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place
 45452	pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so
 45453	barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar
 45454	way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a
 45455	butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course
 45456	hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might
 45457	as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something
 45458	better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because
 45459	they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist
 45460	they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure
 45461	they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I
 45462	wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they
 45463	have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you
 45464	touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying
 45465	passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy
 45466	because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me
 45467	blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long
 45468	into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle
 45469	in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they
 45470	please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different
 45471	tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be
 45472	always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear
 45473	once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we
 45474	all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it
 45475	out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it
 45476	hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other
 45477	mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even
 45478	casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants
 45479	and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to
 45480	know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old
 45481	shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing
 45482	me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I
 45483	suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at
 45484	him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent I atom of any
 45485	kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever
 45486	Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough
 45487	I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss
 45488	our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked
 45489	ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day
 45490	almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love
 45491	or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the
 45492	Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark
 45493	evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be
 45494	hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate
 45495	somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their
 45496	camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if
 45497	they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model
 45498	laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that
 45499	blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me
 45500	in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer
 45501	anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats
 45502	that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the
 45503	night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing
 45504	match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and
 45505	the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was
 45506	a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes
 45507	home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are
 45508	rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for
 45509	the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so
 45510	well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if
 45511	he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to
 45512	sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for
 45513	Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around
 45514	down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled
 45515	up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like
 45516	to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt
 45517	I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be
 45518	governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one
 45519	another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk
 45520	like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses
 45521	yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they
 45522	wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to
 45523	be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be
 45524	if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats
 45525	why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books
 45526	and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I
 45527	suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that
 45528	theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my
 45529	fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind
 45530	in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I
 45531	suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I
 45532	knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well
 45533	Id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same
 45534	since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any
 45535	more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was
 45536	somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting
 45537	God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt
 45538	like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a
 45539	lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of
 45540	the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants
 45541	what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I
 45542	hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a
 45543	dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us
 45544	so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa
 45545	in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young
 45546	hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah
 45547	what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz
 45548	Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of
 45549	Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las
 45550	Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a
 45551	name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like
 45552	her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and
 45553	Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small
 45554	blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I
 45555	dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round
 45556	any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent
 45557	forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the
 45558	name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel
 45559	cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all
 45560	upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can
 45561	tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not
 45562	so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead
 45563	tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his
 45564	breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on
 45565	the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the
 45566	watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the
 45567	kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines
 45568	I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the
 45569	other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to
 45570	introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his
 45571	wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods
 45572	notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things
 45573	come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us
 45574	why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room

 45753	Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
 45754	electronic works
 45755	
 45756	1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
 45757	electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
 45758	and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
 45759	(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
 45760	the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
 45761	all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
 45762	If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
 45763	Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
 45764	terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
 45765	entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
 45766	
 45767	1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
 45768	used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
 45769	agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
 45770	things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
 45771	even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
 45772	paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
 45773	Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
 45774	and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 45775	works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
 45776	
 45777	1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
 45778	or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
 45779	Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
 45780	collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
 45781	individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
 45782	located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
 45783	copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
 45784	works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
 45785	are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
 45786	Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
 45787	freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
 45788	this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
 45789	the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
 45790	keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
 45791	Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
 45792	
 45793	1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 45794	what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
 45795	a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
 45796	the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
 45797	before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
 45798	creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
 45799	Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

 45966	Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
 45967	
 45968	Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 45969	electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 45970	including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 45971	because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 45972	people in all walks of life.
 45973	
 45974	Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 45975	assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 45976	goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 45977	remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 45978	Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 45979	and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

 46011	Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 46012	Literary Archive Foundation
 46013	
 46014	Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 46015	spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 46016	increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 46017	freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 46018	array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 46019	($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 46020	status with the IRS.
 46021	
 46022	The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 46023	charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 46024	States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 46025	considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 46026	with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 46027	where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 46028	SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 46029	particular state visit http://pglaf.org
 46030	
 46031	While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 46032	have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 46033	against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 46034	approach us with offers to donate.
 46035	
 46036	International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 46037	any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 46038	outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
 46039	
 46040	Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 46041	methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 46042	ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
 46043	To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 46046	Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 46047	works.
 46048	
 46049	Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 46050	concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 46051	with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 46052	Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
 46053	
 46054	
 46055	Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 46056	editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 46057	unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 46058	keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
 46059

 46061	Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
 46062	
 46063	     http://www.gutenberg.org
 46064	
 46065	This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 46066	including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 46067	Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
 46068	subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
